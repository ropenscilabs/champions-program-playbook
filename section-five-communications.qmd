# Communications

The communication of the program includes two aspects: the _internal communication_, with its participants, and the _external communication_, to shared and inform the community in general. 

The Champions Program have a communication strategy that contemplates the different stages of the program:  

* *Recruiting champions and mentors:* external communication takes the most time and has the most activities in this phase. The @sec-comm-plan-recruitment details the communication plan for this phase. Internal communication is mostly with rOpenSci staff about the implementation of the plan.

* *Selection and onboarding:* at this stage most of the communications are internal with the people involved in the review and selection processes. Here we also inform the results to all the people who applied to the program. The external plan focus on let our community know about the general numbers of the applications, and the mentors and champions selected. 

* *Training:* internal communication is key for the success of this phase, organizing the training session, sharing the resources, following the progress and providing support for champions and mentors. The external communication focus on sharing the training open materials and provide updates to the community about what champions are doing. 

* *Project development and outreach activity:* both aspect are important in this phase. internal communications are to organize cohort meetings, support mentors and champions in their meetings and organize champion events.  External communications are to support champions in publicizing their outreach activities and programm progress.   

* *Offboarding and evaluation:* internal communication is key for the success of this phase to organize the anonymous surveys, individual interviews and focus groups for evaluation. The external communication contemplates to write funder reports and summarizing activities and results for the wider community. 


## External communication

There will be a series of blog posts introducing participants, thanking mentors and trainers, discussing the champion program, and documenting what has been learned so far. Blog post would be shared on other media and can be complement with other kinds of communication artifacts.

The blog posts will be a way of codifying everything the champions are learning, and shows them how far they’ve come. It also offers visibility for all involved in the program, including mentors, champions, and trainers, as well as being useful content to share with funders.

Blog posts are also a nice way to thank and acknowledge the contributions of all the folks involved in the champion program.

The external communication use the following media:

* Champions Web Page.
* rOpenSci Blog Post and Newsletter.
* rOpenSci Social Media.
* rOpenSci Community Calls and Co-working sessions.
* Events with other communities.

::: callout-note
During the two years pilot of the program the social media landscape changed substantially due to the change of ownership of X (former Twitter), which implied a change in the way the program was communicated externally. 
:::

As the @sec-comm-plan-recruitment details the communication plan for the _Recruiting champions and mentors_ phase and how we use the differents media, in the following sessions we describe the communication plan and tools for the rest of the phase of the Champions Program.

## Selection and onboarding

* The first step is to **inform the results of the call**, e.g. the number of applications received, the type of project and from where are the applicants.  

For example, this blog post for the first cohort [rOpenSci Champions Program Kick off](https://ropensci.org/blog/2023/02/21/champions-program-kick-off/) (also in [Spanish](https://ropensci.org/es/blog/2023/02/21/champions-program-kick-off-es/)) presents general stats for the applications and introduce the selected participants.  Also share information about the kick-off meetings and training activities. 

This Mastodon post is about the second cohort:

All blog post are shared on the monthly newsletter and in some Slack related with the program.

* The second step is to **update the Champions Program** webpage:

- Create an author profile for each Champions and Mentor selected: this will allow Champions and Mentors to be author on different type of contributions to rOpenSci.

- List them on the Champions Program's web page: this means upload their profile picture and add their affiliation and path for communication.

- Remove from the main page all of the information about the open call.

- Add the information about the program's timeline on the main webpage. 

* The third step is **draft the blog post** introducing champions and mentors to the community. We tried two ideas to communicate about the selected champions and mentors. 

#### Blog post series on champions and mentors

For the first cohort we write a series of ten blog posts, two each week. Each one will focus on a
project team, which will typically consist of a champion and mentor, and the content will include who they are (biographical information) and what the project is about.

The Champions and Mentors have already filled out an AirTable form with headshots and other biographical information that will be useful in these blog posts. The Community Manager will create the skeleton with the info she already has, and the champions / mentors can edit it.

This are the published blog post in the series:

  * [rOpenSci Champions Program Teams: Meet Pao Corrales and Adam Sparks](https://ropensci.org/blog/2023/04/13/ropensci-champions-program-teams-meet-pao-corrales-and-adam-sparks/)

For the second cohort, we selected Mentors first because they helped with the review and final selection of champions. We decide to do two blog post, the first one introducing mentors and after the Champions selection was finished one blog post introducing champions.

The process was the same we use for the first cohort strategy regarding using the AirTable picture and information.  We provide better instruction on how to write the text, for example, write your bibliography in the first person.  The result was less time to edit the text for the blog post and less time to review the text by mentors and champions before post them. 

These are the two second cohort's introduction blog post:

## Internal communication

Communication with champions and mentors takes place in the following spaces: 

- Slack (more detail in @sec-infrastructure).
- Email.
- Champions Program meetings (training sessions, cohort meetings, etc.)

The Program Manager share important information using always two channels: Slack and emails. Most of the time is the same message for both media.



## What to do when Champions are disengaged from the program

In the first year, the rOpenSci Community Manager noted that three of
the ten champions were slightly off track from the goals of the program.
One champion had a project idea that was out of scope, while two were
not showing up to the training sessions and meetings.

Each situation will be unique, and so it is important to consider the
champion’s specific circumstances and tailor an intervention to the
needs of the situation. However, some general guidelines can be helpful
when champions are off track:

- *Have one-on-one meetings with the champion and / or their mentor.*
  Often, just talking through the problem can be enough to generate
  solutions.

- *Intervene early and check-in often*. Don’t let the problem get out of
  hand – at the first hints of an issue, reach out to the mentor or
  champion and make sure they are feeling supported.

- If a champion can’t participate for whatever reason, offer the
  opportunity to another applicant.

  - Make expectations for the program clear from the start in early
    communication, and disclose that lack of proper engagement may lead
    to removal from the champion program.

In the three specific situations listed above, speaking with the mentors
and champions allowed the Community Manager to co-create solutions that
fit everyone. The out of scope project will have a different status in
the R ecosystem, but will still benefit from the rOpenSci review process
and therefore be fast-tracked to publishing in a journal. Meanwhile, the
disengagement was handled by changing training schedules to be more
accommodating.


## Helpful technology for communications and documentation

A useful program called Cartero sends out personalized emails, and the
Community Manager only has to give an email template and list of names.

Another program called Quartificate creates quarto books automatically:
[*rOpenSci Community Contributing
Guide*](https://contributing.ropensci.org/) (Yani has one for mentors
and champions)

- [*Transform Google Doc to Quarto
  book*](https://docs.ropensci.org/quartificate/reference/quartificate.html)

- The Community Manager needs to settle questions around how private or
  public facing quarto books should be, and what personal content it
  should include (e.g., contact info)




## Time Zone Concerns

Given the explicit goal of including a diverse range of people in the
champion program, the issue of time zones has emerged – champions have
nine hour time differences. It is important to organize training
sessions accommodating these time zones, and to take into account that
the United States and the UK have Daylight Savings time in March and
November which disrupt typical time differences.

An important solution is to ask for the applicant’s time zone in the
application form for the champion program to ensure that all those
accepted will have some working-hour overlap in which they are able to
meet.

A helpful resource for planning across time zones is this [*Time Zone
Converter – Time Difference
Calculator*](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html)
which allows you to compare times in several time zones at once and
determine whether it is during waking hours or not.

## Coffee Chats

The Community Manager should set up coffee chats for the champions. This
is a great way to give them permission to reach out to one another
outside of facilitated chats, and allows them to connect outside of
official meeting times. It will add to the sense of camaraderie and
community if they have personal connections to one another; champions
have already noted and interest in engaging with each other outside of
training sessions.
