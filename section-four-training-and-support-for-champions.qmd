# Training and support for champions

## Overview

Champions will receive training on (1) how to plan and facilitate engaging and inclusive workshops to support participants’ success (by CSCCE), (2) channels through which new members can engage in and contribute to Open Source projects, and (3) technical skills in software development and review. This series of 60 to 180-minute sessions will be supplemented by ongoing peer connection in a private Slack channel so that champions expand their own professional support networks while gaining new skills.

After training, champions will organize peer groups in communities in which they are embedded. They will promote participation in peer review and contribution to rOpenSci open source software, infrastructure, and documentation and gather feedback on where rOpenSci’s current programming might be improved to meet the needs of all who wish to participate. The tenure and responsibilities of each cohort will have clear start and end dates and champions will receive an honorarium.

## Trainers

While the Community Manager has led and helped organize many of the training sessions, trainers have come from outside of the Champions program. Having a diversity of trainers helps support the mission of the Champion Program to increase access to the R ecosystem.

### Technical Skills Track

-   [**Beautiful Code, Because We’re Worth It!.**](https://stylish-code.netlify.app/#/) Added for the second cohort is a one-hour session to present [good practices on writing code](https://ropensci.org/blog/2024/02/22/beautiful-code/). It is the first session of the technical training.

-   [**Package Development: The Mechanics**](https://rpkgdev-mechanics.netlify.app/)**.** two-hour hands-on session with a live demo on creating R packages hosted by rOpenSci staff Maëlle Salmon and Yanina Bellini Saibene. For the second cohort, we split this training into [three 2-hour sessions](https://rpkgdev-mechanics-2024.netlify.app/) with more content and more time for the hands-on exercises. It is training for beginners to demystify the creation of an R package.

-   [**Package Development: Not Rocket Science**](https://rpkgdev-rocket.netlify.app/)**.** two-hour hands-on workshop for advanced R package development with several tips and tricks on package development hosted by rOpenSci staff Maëlle Salmon and Yanina Bellini Saibene. 

-   [**How rOpenSci Performs Peer Review**](https://github.com/maurolepore/ropensci-review)**.** one-hour workshop to showcase and discuss how rOpenSci communicates, builds, and reviews software with selected examples and resources hosted by rOpenSci community member and mentor Mauro Lepore. We add one more session with case analysis and practices, for the second cohort.

-   [**Developing Software Together**](https://paocorrales.github.io/git-developing-software-together/). 3-hour course on using Git and GitHub to collaboratively develop open-source software with the R language. Hosted by the champion Paola Corrales and rOpenSci staff Yanina Bellini Saibene.

-   [**How to contribute to base R**](https://ropensci.org/events/2023-05-18-how-to-contribute-base-r/) 1-hour workshop with a walk-through of how to contribute to base R. It included how to contribute to a bug, confirm a bug, diagnose a bug, and propose a fix to code/documentation hosted by R Foundation member Heather Turner.

### Organizational Skills

-   **Making a PACT for engaging virtual meetings and events.** 1.5-hour workshop hosted by CSCCE. Participants explored designing and facilitating engaging and productive virtual meetings and events.

-   **Path for contributing to rOpenSci.** Added for the second cohort. One 2-hour session to present paths for collaboration and engagement beyond the champions program.

-   **Teaching and Learning Tech Together.** This was added for the second cohort. It is a 3-hour session with evidence-based pedagogical concepts to apply in teaching, events, talks, mentoring, documentation, and other spaces where we need to share content and knowledge. 

### Making a PACT for engaging virtual meetings and events

In this 90-minute mini-workshop hosted by the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement, participants explore how to design and facilitate engaging and productive virtual meetings and events. Participants discuss the opportunities and challenges of working together online and outline the “Making a PACT” framework for effective meeting design. In addition to examples of the framework in action, attendees have an opportunity to apply it directly to some example scenarios so that participants leave feeling empowered to use the framework in their own work.

Participants are welcome to review the CSCCE’s free guidebook on Zenodo ahead of the session: [*A guide to using virtual events to facilitation community building: Making a PACT for more engaging virtual meetings and events*](https://zenodo.org/record/4987666#.Y-1Y4nbMK5c)

All champions must complete this training.

### How rOpenSci Performs Peer Review

This one-hour workshop is for people who might want to try rOpenSci review process. We will go through

The way we communicate, The way we build and review software. We will check selected examples, resources

and then some time for Questions and comments.

Materials: [*https://github.com/maurolepore/ropensci-review*](https://github.com/maurolepore/ropensci-review)

This training is for champions that will send a package to review or will become reviewers.

#### Invitation mail template

“Dear Champions and Mentors. This is the invitation to our next training session on how rOpenSci performs peer-review.

Mauro Lepore will be our speaker. Mauro is part of the rOpenSci review process and has served in different roles: reviewer, editor, and editor-in-chief. And he is also one of our mentors!!

This training is open to all. It is especially important for champions who are going to send a package for review or are going to become a reviewer. It is optional for mentors.”

### How to contribute to base R

This workshop is a 60-minute walkthrough of how to contribute to base R. The outline includes How we can contribute to a bug, confirm a bug, diagnose a bug, and propose a fix to code/documentation.

The workshop shows tools and strategies to find a bug to work on and what features make it good for first-timer to work on. It has examples and exercises on how to triage bugs. Then show how to debug code/documentation with collaborative hand on. Next, show how to fix a bug by commenting on Bugzilla and a demo on creating a patch with git workflow. Finally, share pointers to further help and resources.

This training was developed for the Champion Program, taught by \[Hether Turner\](/author/heather-turner/), and is open to all champions and mentors.

## Training for non-selected applicants

[*Developing Software Together*](https://paocorrales.github.io/git-developing-software-together/)

## Training for mentors

## Sharing materials from the trainings and program (revisit at the end of 2022-2023 Champions tenure):

The rOpenSci Community Manager shares [*the materials*](https://rpkgdev-mechanics.netlify.app/) from each training session online after it’s completed. When the first year is over, the Community Manager should reflect on how to make the project open source in its entirety, including information on how to organize a champions program. After the first year, the goal is to make the project primarily open.

Much of the content and training for this program has been developed by the Community Manager, Yani, and one of the main trainers, Maelle. They are interested in sharing this knowledge with the rest of the R community.

## Post-training programming

### Office hours and co-working sessions

After training sessions, the champions may benefit from office hours and / or co-working sessions to ask questions about what they’ve learned and apply it to their own package development projects.

Maelle, one of the main trainers, has a wealth of knowledge and would be a very useful resource to pull into office hours.

### Resources and support for Champions’ outreach activities

-   List of potential events to participate

    -   Apply for scholarships to present at conferences

-   Yani has been redirecting invitations to talk or teach to the champions

    -   Share in Slack

    -   Targeted invites to champions and mentors - tends to work better

    -   Champions have been paid to participate

-   Start a resources folder with logos, slides, etc. so the champions can use it in their events)
