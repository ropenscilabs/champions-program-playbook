# Training and support for champions

## Overview

Champions will receive training on (1) how to plan and facilitate
engaging and inclusive workshops to support participants’ success (by
CSCCE), (2) channels through which new members can engage in and
contribute to rOpenSci and R projects, and (3) technical skills in
software development and review. This series of 60 to 180-minute
sessions will be supplemented by ongoing peer connection in a private
Slack channel so that champions expand their own professional support
networks while gaining new skills.

After training, champions will organize peer groups in communities in
which they are embedded. They will promote participation in peer review
and contribution to rOpenSci open source software, infrastructure, and
documentation and gather feedback on where rOpenSci’s current
programming might be improved to meet the needs of all who wish to
participate. The tenure and responsibilities of each cohort will have
clear start and end dates and champions will receive an honorarium.

We will develop peer mentorship groups to support participants from
historically excluded groups in their first technical contributions.
Peer-mentorship groups will be facilitated by rOpenSci technical and
community management staff, and also by community champions after Year
One. Facilitators will provide training for technical activities
(preparing a pull request, reviewing a package, preparing a package for
submission or publication on rOpenSci infrastructure). Training will be
followed by group “office hours”, 1-on-1 support, and closed group chats
to support first-time participants in making their first open-source
contributions through rOpenSci.

## Trainers

While the Community Manager has led and helped organize many of the
training sessions, trainers have come from outside of the Champions
program. Having a diversity of trainers helps support the mission of the
Champion Program to increase access to the R ecosystem.

### Making a PACT for engaging virtual meetings and events

In this 90-minute mini-workshop hosted by the Center for Scientific
Collaboration and Community Engagement, participants explore how to
design and facilitate engaging and productive virtual meetings and
events. Participants discuss the opportunities and challenges of working
together online and outline the “Making a PACT” framework for effective
meeting design. In addition to examples of the framework in action,
attendees have an opportunity to apply it directly to some example
scenarios so that participants leave feeling empowered to use the
framework in their own work.

Participants are welcome to review the CSCCE’s free guidebook on Zenodo
ahead of the session: [*A guide to using virtual events to facilitation
community building: Making a PACT for more engaging virtual meetings and
events*](https://zenodo.org/record/4987666#.Y-1Y4nbMK5c)

All champions must complete this training.

### Package Development: The Mechanics

In this two-hour session with a live demo, an rOpenSci trainer
demystifies the creation of an R package. R packages are mostly
well-organized folders, and there are automatic tools to help such as
usethis. This workshop is for R users who have not previously developed
or contributed to packages.

Training materials:
[*https://rpkgdev-mechanics.netlify.app/*](https://rpkgdev-mechanics.netlify.app/)

It is intended for champions who are planning to develop a package and
have no experience in this task.

### Package Development: Not Rocket Science

This two-hour workshop is for R users who’ve already developed or
contributed to packages. Ideally, participants attend with a package of
their own to use as a playground.

It is intended for champions who are planning to develop a package or
send a package to review and want to learn several tips and tricks on
package development.

### How rOpenSci Performs Peer Review

This one-hour workshop is for people who might want to try rOpenSci
review process. We will go through

The way we communicate, The way we build and review software. We will
check selected examples, resources

and then some time for Questions and comments.

Materials:
[*https://github.com/maurolepore/ropensci-review*](https://github.com/maurolepore/ropensci-review)

This training is for champions that will send a package to review or
will become reviewers.

#### Invitation mail template

“Dear Champions and Mentors. This is the invitation to our next training
session on how rOpenSci performs peer-review.

Mauro Lepore will be our speaker. Mauro is part of the rOpenSci review
process and has served in different roles: reviewer, editor, and
editor-in-chief. And he is also one of our mentors!!

This training is open to all. It is especially important for champions
who are going to send a package for review or are going to become a
reviewer. It is optional for mentors.”

### How to contribute to base R

This workshop is a 60-minute walkthrough of how to contribute to base R.
The outline includes How we can contribute to a bug, confirm a bug,
diagnose a bug, and propose a fix to code/documentation.

The workshop shows tools and strategies to find a bug to work on and
what features make it good for first-timer to work on. It has examples
and exercises on how to triage bugs. Then show how to debug
code/documentation with collaborative hand on. Next, show how to fix a
bug by commenting on Bugzilla and a demo on creating a patch with git
workflow. Finally, share pointers to further help and resources.

This training was developed for the Champion Program, taught by \[Hether
Turner\](/author/heather-turner/), and is open to all champions and
mentors.

## Training for mentors

## Sharing materials from the trainings and program (revisit at the end of 2022-2023 Champions tenure):

The rOpenSci Community Manager shares [*the
materials*](https://rpkgdev-mechanics.netlify.app/) from each training
session online after it’s completed. When the first year is over, the
Community Manager should reflect on how to make the project open source
in its entirety, including information on how to organize a champions
program. After the first year, the goal is to make the project primarily
open.

Much of the content and training for this program has been developed by
the Community Manager, Yani, and one of the main trainers, Maelle. They
are interested in sharing this knowledge with the rest of the R
community.

## Post-training programming

### Office hours and co-working sessions

After training sessions, the champions may benefit from office hours and
/ or co-working sessions to ask questions about what they’ve learned and
apply it to their own package development projects.

Maelle, one of the main trainers, has a wealth of knowledge and would be
a very useful resource to pull into office hours.

### Resources and support for Champions’ outreach activities

- List of potential events to participate

  - Apply for scholarships to present at conferences

- Yani has been redirecting invitations to talk or teach to the
  champions

  - Share in Slack

  - Targeted invites to champions and mentors - tends to work better

  - Champions have been paid to participate

- Start a resources folder with logos, slides, etc. so the champions can
  use it in their events)
