# Onboarding of champions and mentors

## Overview

This section describes the onboarding process for both champions and
mentors. Prior to onboarding meetings, a number of scaffolding pieces
are put into place, including a Google Drive, Slack, and templates for
meetings between mentors and champions. Once participants are selected,
mentors and champions meet each other during the program kick-off
meeting. Next, mentors attend a training and orientation meeting to
share expectations and tools needed for the program.

## Onboarding process

#### Step 1: Kick-off meeting / initial mentor/mentee introductions

The community manager hosts a kick-off meeting to introduce the
champions and mentors to each other, provide an overview of the program,
review the tentative training schedule and expectations for the program.
The community manager also shares information about tool and
infrastructure that will be used to communicate and collaborate during
the program, such as Slack, Google Drive, template docs, and shared
calendar.

#### Step 2: Mentor training and orientation meeting

After the initial kickoff, the mentors have a 75 minute meeting with the
rOpenSci Community Manager with the purpose of giving them tools,
skills, and guidance to provide good mentorship to the champions.

The overarching message of the meeting is that the role of a mentor is
to advise and inspire. They can do this by recommending resources,
offering feedback, and connecting their mentees to other people or
programs.

The content of the first meeting can be broken down into a skills and
tools section.

The skills are aimed at:

- Active listening

- Effective questioning

- Giving feedback

Tools include guidance on:

- Setting expectations for meetings

- The GROW Model for exploring and reflecting

  - Goal: Agree on a topic & objective or longer-term goals

  - Reality: self-assessment, specific examples

  - Options: suggestions offered & choices made

  - Way forward: next steps

During the meeting, mentors also have time to reflect on their own
mentorship experiences (as a mentor or mentee), practice the GROW model,
and consider their readiness for being a mentor.

#### Step 3: Champion and mentor 1-on-1 meetings

Mentors are positioned to help champions progress their projects, answer
questions, and provide motivation and support. One way for the pair to
keep up to date with each other is by monthly 1-on-1 meetings, of which
they are expected to have around 11 and can have more. The meetings
should be about 30 minutes, but can be shorter or longer depending on
both people’s needs and availability.

Mentor and champion pairs are expected to decide on meeting times and
platforms with each other and are provided with a
[*list*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oEN_6anF2hlUJcHOqL78kVDK9W1pl4zW3BUtgozI0AE/edit#heading=h.ierqx96guq2c)
of potential collaboration platforms including Zoom, Slack, WhatsApp,
Google Docs, and When2Meet. They are also expected to read, implement,
and abide by rOpenSci’s [*Code of
Conduct*](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/) in their meetings and
interactions.

After the mentor orientation, the mentors are given a
[*template*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vjmfbjv9ABJ6fkbtQRMFPydJZ3ypKOIpZ-xf7_iBhvo/edit)
for their first meeting with their mentees and asked to set an agenda
with goals, possible areas they can investigate, and expectations for
each other. Mentors are expected to complete a form to confirm with the
community manager that these monthly meetings are taking place.

Subsequent meetings between the two will be structured as a check-in to
ensure that the champion is keeping up with their goals and to answer
any questions they may have. The final meeting will offer an opportunity
for both to celebrate their accomplishments and offer feedback. More
details about the meetings can be found in the [*Mentorship
Meetings*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oEN_6anF2hlUJcHOqL78kVDK9W1pl4zW3BUtgozI0AE/edit#heading=h.k5vsm0igh6zd)
section of the Mentor Guidebook.
