# Recruitment and selection

## Overview

The recruitment process for Champions and mentors should begin at least four months before the program start date to ensure there is adequate time to promote the opportunity, review applications, and communicate with successful and unsuccessful applicants.

During the first year, we received 74 champion applications and 28 mentor applications. In the second year we received 98 Champions applications and 28 mentors applications - so this process can take a significant amount of time!

![](images/applications-map.jpg){fig-alt="World map with a colored scales representing the number of applications. America is almost all colored with the maximun number of applications, followed by Europe, Oceania, Africa and Asia."}

To ensure a broad range of applications from people across the world, we strive to offer information about the program in different languages. However, at this time, all applications must be written in English.

Below are details about the recruitment process for both Champions and mentors including the applications, the communications plan and selection process.

## Applications

The application process for both Champions and mentors is intentionally lightweight and consists of an Airtable form and accompanying list of questions that applicants can review prior to submission.

Potential Champions Program applicants are encouraged to attend an optional Community Call to learn more about the program and the application process. They may also attend an optional coworking session to work on their applications together, and/or book a brief 15-minute meeting with the community manager to get feedback on their applications.

## Communications plan {#sec-comm-plan-recruitment}

rOpenSci’s standard communication channels are used to spread the news about the Champions Program. There is a dedicated [webpage](https://ropensci.org/champions/), a blog post announcing the program, and accompanying communications to promote the opportunity on social media and various listservs. In addition, the community manager hosts a Community Call about the program. The community manager may also speak at events and meetings hosted by other organizations to ensure the broadest possible reach.

Before beginning, decide which languages the recruitment materials will be translated into and identify translators if necessary. Remember to consider all the materials that will need to be translated (blog posts, Community Call video captions, social media posts (Mastodon, LinkedIn, Slack), slides, and emails).

::: callout-note
### Internal Documents
The materials outlined below are saved in the Google Drive folder: [2. Communications plan](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UlW185xJI3NQ1soPnu4GhwvaMd85W1aD).

### Update program web pages

First, review the program webpage text and update as appropriate with new **key dates and application materials**.

The [Champions Program webpage](https://ropensci.org/champions/): present the information about:

-   General information like goals, format, and training.

-   Specifici information for [Champions](https://ropensci.org/champions/programdetails_2023/) and [mentors](https://ropensci.org/champions/programdetailsmentors_2023/) including eligibility criteria, benefits of taking part, expectations, timeline for the program, FAQs, and templates.

-   Application timelines (example from the 2023-2024 call):

-   Training materials.

-   Events and blog posts about the Champions Program.

-   Once selected, a list of Champions and Mentors for each cohort.

::: callout-tip
For the first cohort when creating the website from scratch it is important to carefully consider the program objectives, measures of success, format, target audience, and languages.
This can be a large amount of work the first time. However, it will be much more straightforward for future cohorts.
:::

### Announcements

Once the web pages have been updated, the community manager drafts text to announce the the opportunity. This includes announcements through blog posts, newsletters, and social media.
If possible, these posts are translated into other languages and blog posts may be linked to in additional outreach efforts such as social media posts and newsletters.

The program should be first announced on the rOpenSci blog, newsletter, Slack, and social media sites.

</div>


### Further promotion

Once the program has been announced in rOpenSci-specific channels, 
further promotion through rOpenSci and promotion on other mailing lists and/or Slack workspaces can begin. 

#### Presentations

To ensure a broad range of applicants it may be helpful to give short presentations about the program at events or meetings hosted by other organisations or communities.

Update the timeline for the application, but also add material regarding the outcomes of the previous cohort, such as the type of projects and training topics.

After a presentation, make sure to post the recordings on the rOpenSci Event Page.

##### Example Slides:

- [English Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Bah05iiIFM4lgOmqSAFNP8dZAfn3LXgoTjlIBxQg5nw/edit?usp=sharing) - Abuja RUG 2022-2023 ([Recording](https://ropensci.org/events/abuja-2022/))

- [Spanish Slides](https://rocp2324.netlify.app) - R-Ladies Buenos Aires and R-Ladies Santa Rosa 2023-2024 ([Recording](https://vimeo.com/854320485))

#### Personal emails
It is also useful for the community manager to reach out individually to prospective mentors and Champions 
and invite them to apply to the program.

::: callout-tip
Email messages were the best media for individual outreach. 
In the message, it is important to include when and where the program manager knows the person and why they think they are a good fit for the Champions Program.

Remember to provide a way for individuals to be removed from future communications about the Champions Program.
:::

#### Other communities

![Post with important dates and a community partner post sharing the second cohort call](images/social-media-examples-2.jpg)

We create checklists with all the social media, Slack workspaces, and mailing lists where we will share the open call of the Champions Program. 
These checklists are created as an issue on GitHub (called [task list](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/about-task-lists)). 
This issue helps to keep track of our dissemination task. 
We also note in what language is best to do the communication in each space to create the content.

:::

### Host application support activities

The community manager should plan two live sessions to support potential applicants: 1) a community call, and 2) a coworking session.

#### Community Call

The Community Call is a place where applicants can ask specific questions about the application process. 
The call will involve former Champions and mentors sharing their experiences and providing advice on how to apply.

##### Example Calls
- [2022-2023 Community Call](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/oct2022-champions/)
- [2023-2024 Community Call](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/july2023-championprogram/)

::: callout-tip
## First Community Call

For the first community call, you can invite people from other Champions and ambassador programs to share how these programs benefit participants and their communities.
:::

#### Coworking 
rOpenSci has 2-hour monthly coworking sessions organized in different time zones each time.
We organize extra coworking sessions specifically as a space for people to come and work on their applications together in real time, where they will have the chance to review their proposals and to ask questions about the program.

## Selection and matching process

For the first cohort the rOpenSci staff team was responsible for selecting both Champions and mentors using screening rubrics.

For the second cohort the rOpenSci staff team was responsible for selecting mentors using screening rubric and then rOpenSci Champions Program Team and selected mentors review and select the final group of Champions.

Below are details about each step of the selection and matching process, including suggested timelines.

### Step 1: Two rOpenSci Team members review application to confirm completion

After the application deadline, the community manager with other team member review *Champions* and *mentors* applications and set aside any candidates that don’t meet the basic criteria. Those application that are not complete or the project is not on the scope of the Champions Program are remove from the list.

### Step 2: Community manager assigns **mentors** applications to reviewers (1 week)

The community manager can evenly assign applications to each reviewer, taking into account any conflicts of interest. Each application has two reviews.

### Step 3: Selection team reviews their assigned mentors applicants (2 weeks)

The reviewers should consider all their assigned applications using the screening rubric and set aside any candidates that don’t meet the basic criteria.

In a slack private direct message group, the team discusses any doubts during the review. The doubts may be related to the rubric, to details in the application, etc

-   [rOpenSci Champions Mentors rubric template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10nEclohvEKZNyma7tz1ztvkJOz4gERZGfuahGWNp1mE/edit?usp=sharing).

### Step 4: Meeting to discuss mentors applicants and final selection (1 week)

The selection committee should meet to discuss the top applicants. The goal of this meeting is to settle on a final list.

Before the meeting the community manager reviews all the applications with their scoring and prepares the final list for mentors ordering the applications according to the score they obtained. The CM marks with different colors according to the scoring: definite yes, possible yes, or unsure.

The reviewers initially consider the definite and possible yeses which may be up to twice as many candidates who can be selected. Reviewers should take into account not only the ranking but also the country/region they come from, type of project they want to mentor, languages spoken, and gender.

### Step 5: Inform mentors applicants (2 weeks)

Once you have selected the top applicants, prepare individual messages to each person to inform them and request them to confirm their participation by a certain date. If for some reason a successful applicant can no longer participate, you can invite the next best applicant to take their place.

After all selected mentors have confirmed their participation, prepare messages to inform applicants who were no selected.

### Step 6: Community manager assigns **Champions** applications to reviewers (1 week)

The community manager can evenly assign applications to each reviewer, taking into account any conflicts of interest. Each application has two reviews.

Mentors for the current cohort are reviewers. Because of the high number of application we also invite mentor from previews cohort to review. We aim to assign between 10 to 20 applications to each reviewer.

### Step 7: Selection team reviews their assigned Champions applicants (2 weeks)

The reviewers should consider all their assigned applications using the screening rubric.

In a slack private channel, the team discusses any doubts during the review. The doubts may be related to the rubric, to details in the application, etc

The team should take care to write substantive feedback as we attempt to provide each applicant with feedback that may be helpful to them in the future.

-   [*rOpenSci Champions screening rubric template*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZySOzrMSYq6OlMgWpYOBZedO9FVkOsPe_e-lqcUYQyQ/edit?usp=sharing)

::: callout-tip
The full application is provide in the spreadsheet, but that format can be hard to read. We also provide a document in PDF format of each application when reviewers requested. 
:::

### Step 8: Consistency Analysis, and Diversity and Representation Review (1 week)

A quantitative analysis is conducted to examine the consensus among reviewers. This step ensures that revisions are aligned, promoting fairness and minimizing bias in the selection process.

With a focus on diversity and representation, the list of candidates with higher scores is then carefully reviewed to ensure it reflects a broad spectrum of backgrounds and regions. This may involve adding promising candidates to the pool to achieve a truly representative group of potential Champions. The program manager create a top candidate list that double the number of spots.

### Step 9: Final Selection by Mentors (1 week).

The culmination of the process consists of mentors reviewing the top candidates to select their mentees. Mentors tag every candidate with these options:

-   3 projects with “I want to mentor this project.”
-   7 projects “Should be part of the Champions.”
-   10 projects “No selected this time.”

::: callout-tip
Involving mentors in the selection process significantly enhances the mentor-mentee relationship, as mentors' insights into the selection process ensure a more effective and synergistic pairing. This involvement is crucial for identifying which projects resonate most with mentors, thereby facilitating a more informed and meaningful final match.
:::

### Step 10: Final match mentor-mentee (1 week).

The program manager create the final match, taking into account the preference for the project, that the Champions and mentors are in compatible time zones and speak a common language.

::: callout-tip
the blog post [Fostering Equity and Leadership: the rOpenSci Champions Program Selection Process](https://ropensci.org/blog/2024/04/18/champions-program-2024/) explain the process in detail and shows the 2023-2024 cohort results. 
:::

### Step 11: Inform applicants (2 weeks)

Once you have selected the top applicants, prepare individual messages to each person to inform them and request them to confirm their participation by a certain date. If for some reason a successful applicant can no longer participate, you can invite the next best applicant to take their place (already matched in the previews step).

After all selected Champions have confirmed their participation, prepare messages to inform applicants who were no selected. Whenever possible, we try to include specific feedback to each applicant, so they can make improvements for next time. We also strive to direct them to other rOpenSci activities or opportunities that may be of interest to them.

::: callout-note
When the review takes longer than planned, we inform the applicants the status of the process by email.
