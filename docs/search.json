    "section": "2.1 Program background and rationale",
    "text": "2.1 Program background and rationale\nIn 2022, rOpenSci was awarded $400K in funding as part of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) Open Science program’s education and capacity building strategy. The funding supports a new champions program to enable more members of historically excluded groups to participate in, benefit from, and become leaders in the R, research software engineering, and open source and open science communities.\nDevelopers in the R and open source communities are overwhelmingly white, male, from a handful of countries, able, and primarily English-speaking. The rOpenSci Champions Program is for people from historically and systematically excluded groups who are interested in contributing to rOpenSci and the broader open-source and open-science communities.\nThe 12-month-long program includes cohort-based training, project development support, and personal mentorship. Each cohort has ten champions and ten mentors. Champions participate in the following activities:\n\nTraining: this is the first stage. Champions will learn about open-source scientific software development good practices, R package development, code peer-open-review, contribute to open-source software initiatives and communities, and organize outreach activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOne of the goals of this program was to ensure that all participants gained new skills and understanding. We wanted to support Champions and Mentors, as well as those who applied to the program but were not selected. Therefore, we ensured that all groups had access to different training opportunities.\n\n\n\nIndividual Project development: Champions must develop the project they propose in their application. They have three options: develop a new R package or become part of the software peer review process as an author or as a reviewer.\nOutreach activity: the third stage involves an outreach activity for their home institution or local community. Examples of activities are: writing a blog post, teaching a workshop, talking at an event or organizing a meetup.\nMentoring and cohort: During each stage of the program, there is 1:1 mentoring and quarterly cohort meetings.\nStipend: we also pay a stipend to champions for participating. This has been important for champions to be able to dedicate time to the activity.\n\n\n\nChampions Program elements",

    "text": "2.2 Program goals\nThe rOpenSci Champions Program aims to support R developers from around the world who identify as members of a group that is systematically excluded from the open software community. Participants will:\n\nGain the skills to develop their own R package or gain confidence in submitting an R package for peer review or become a reviewer.\nLearn how to lead a workshop or other event about package development or software peer review - or another rOpenSci activity - in their local community or host institution.\nConnect with a supportive network of peers and mentors within the R ecosystem.\nProvide feedback to help rOpenSci to continue to host relevant, welcoming activities for R developers.\nGain transferable skills and experiences that are sought after for careers in open-source software.\n\nSuccess will look like:\n\nOver 80% of selected champions complete training and cohort meetings\nMentors and mentees build rapport during the program and a strong working relationship. This looks like:\n\nSchedule and attend regular check-ins\nTimely feedback on projects\n\nOver 80% of selected champions will either:\n\nBuild a new package\nComplete the peer review process as an author\nComplete the peer review process as a reviewer\n\nAll selected champions will conduct at least one outreach and/or recruitment activity to promote participation in peer review and contribution to rOpenSci open source software, infrastructure, and documentation. Examples include:\n\nGiving a presentation about rOpenSci at their home institution\nWriting a blog post\nOrganizing a peer groups in their communities\n\nAll champions and mentors will gather and share feedback on where rOpenSci’s current programming might be improved to meet the needs of all who wish to participate. Feedback may be shared in the following ways:\n\nVia email to the rOpenSci community manager\nVerbally, during training\nVia questionnaires / surveys",

This agreement helps to set and clarify expectation for the program.\n\nrOpenSci Champions Program - Champions Pledge 2024\nAttendance\nYou’re expected to attend each of the different meetings and activities for the champions program. You are also expected to attend all the meetings you will agree with your mentor.\nThe rOpenSci Champions Program is a peer-based mentoring program, meaning a significant part of your experience will take place with your cohort. Your attendance at the kickoff, training, and cohort meetings is crucial to your group’s mutual success.\nWe will ask you to let us know beforehand If you’re unable to attend an activity. It is important to organize it and find a way for you to complete the activities. We want you to succeed in the program, so we will contact you If you miss four or more meetings or you are not engaged with the program to discuss your participation. We want to ensure you and your group have an impactful and worthwhile experience.\nParticipation\nWe want you and your peers to grow enormously, and your engagement is key to that. Make intentional time to read the resources, provide feedback, and, when asked, complete the activities ahead of your meetings to get the most out of the training and other activities.\nThe Slack channels with other champions and mentors and the Slack workspace with the general rOpenSci community are vital spaces for communication and engagement.\nWe will ask you for anonymous feedback on the program activities. This feedback will inform our decision on the program improvement.\nSound good?\nPlease sign below (by checking the box and sending the form) to indicate that you have read this agreement, consent to us collecting these data, and that you understand and agree to the terms described in this agreement.\n\n\n\n4.3.2.3 Kick-off meeting and initial mentor/mentee introductions\nThe community manager hosts a kick-off meeting to introduce the champions to each other, provide an overview of the program, review the tentative training schedule and expectations for the program.\nThe community manager also shares information about tool and infrastructure that will be used to communicate and collaborate during the program, such as Slack, Google Drive, template docs, and shared calendar.\nKick-off meeting materials:\n\nSlides Champion Program KickOff 2022-2023\nTemplate Shared Notes - KickOff 2022-2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor accessibility reason google docs are not always the best option to share notes.

All information is available with open license and up to date on the Champions Program web site and this playbook.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Champion and mentor 1-on-1 meetings\nMentors are positioned to help champions progress their projects, answer questions, and provide motivation and support. One way for the pair to keep up to date with each other is by monthly 1-on-1 meetings, of which they are expected to have around 10 and can have more. The meetings should be about 30 minutes, but can be shorter or longer depending on both people’s needs and availability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe program expectation is that mentors will contact their mentee and organize the firts meeting.\nOne of the topic to discuss during that meeting is how they will work together during the program.\n\n\nMentor and champion pairs are expected to decide on meeting times and platforms with each other and are provided with a list of potential collaboration platforms including Zoom, Slack, WhatsApp, Google Docs, and When2Meet. They are also expected to read, implement, and abide by rOpenSci’s Code of Conduct in their meetings and interactions.\nAfter the mentor orientation, the mentors are given a template for their first meeting with their mentees and asked to set an agenda with goals, possible areas they can investigate, and expectations for each other. Mentors are expected to complete a form to confirm with the community manager that these monthly meetings are taking place.\nSubsequent meetings between the two will be structured as a check-in to ensure that the champion is keeping up with their goals and to answer any questions they may have. The meeting template document also provide agenda suggestion for these meetings. The final meeting will offer an opportunity for both to celebrate their accomplishments and offer feedback. More details about the meetings can be found in the Mentorship Meetings section of the Mentor Guidelines book.",

This series of 60 to 180-minute sessions will be supplemented by ongoing peer connection in a private Slack channel so that champions expand their own professional support networks while gaining new skills.\nAfter training, champions will organize peer groups in communities in which they are embedded. They will promote participation in peer review and contribution to rOpenSci open source software, infrastructure, and documentation and gather feedback on where rOpenSci’s current programming might be improved to meet the needs of all who wish to participate. The tenure and responsibilities of each cohort will have clear start and end dates and champions will receive an honorarium.",

This is the invitation to our next training session on how rOpenSci performs peer-review.\nMauro Lepore will be our speaker. Mauro is part of the rOpenSci review process and has served in different roles: reviewer, editor, and editor-in-chief. And he is also one of our mentors!!\nThis training is open to all. It is especially important for champions who are going to send a package for review or are going to become a reviewer. It is optional for mentors.”\n\n\n\n5.3.5 How to contribute to base R\nThis workshop is a 60-minute walkthrough of how to contribute to base R. The outline includes How we can contribute to a bug, confirm a bug, diagnose a bug, and propose a fix to code/documentation.\nThe workshop shows tools and strategies to find a bug to work on and what features make it good for first-timer to work on. It has examples and exercises on how to triage bugs. Then show how to debug code/documentation with collaborative hand on. Next, show how to fix a bug by commenting on Bugzilla and a demo on creating a patch with git workflow. Finally, share pointers to further help and resources.\nThis training was developed for the Champion Program, taught by [Hether Turner](/author/heather-turner/), and is open to all champions and mentors.\nTraining material: https://ropensci.org/events/2023-05-18-how-to-contribute-base-r/",

    "text": "6.2 What to do when Champions are disengaged from the program\nIn the first year, the rOpenSci Community Manager noted that three of the ten champions were slightly off track from the goals of the program. One champion had a project idea that was out of scope, while two were not showing up to the training sessions and meetings.\nEach situation will be unique, and so it is important to consider the champion’s specific circumstances and tailor an intervention to the needs of the situation. However, some general guidelines can be helpful when champions are off track:\n\nHave one-on-one meetings with the champion and / or their mentor. Often, just talking through the problem can be enough to generate solutions.\nIntervene early and check-in often. Don’t let the problem get out of hand – at the first hints of an issue, reach out to the mentor or champion and make sure they are feeling supported.\nIf a champion can’t participate for whatever reason, offer the opportunity to another applicant.\n\nMake expectations for the program clear from the start in early communication, and disclose that lack of proper engagement may lead to removal from the champion program.\n\n\nIn the three specific situations listed above, speaking with the mentors and champions allowed the Community Manager to co-create solutions that fit everyone. The out of scope project will have a different status in the R ecosystem, but will still benefit from the rOpenSci review process and therefore be fast-tracked to publishing in a journal. Meanwhile, the disengagement was handled by changing training schedules to be more accommodating.",

Each one will focus on a project team, which will typically consist of a champion and mentor, and the content will include who they are (biographical information) and what the project is about.\nThe champions and mentors have already filled out an airtable form with headshots and other biographical information that will be useful in these blog posts.

It is important to organize training sessions accommodating these time zones, and to take into account that the United States and the UK have Daylight Savings time in March and November which disrupt typical time differences.\nAn important solution is to ask for the applicant’s time zone in the application form for the champion program to ensure that all those accepted will have some working-hour overlap in which they are able to meet.\nA helpful resource for planning across time zones is this Time Zone Converter – Time Difference Calculator which allows you to compare times in several time zones at once and determine whether it is during waking hours or not.",

When half of the session were completed the time of the session changes to accommodate better those champions that can’t attend the first option synchronously.\nThis configuration is a good mix between flexibility in the timing of training and knowing the schedule in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor the first cohort we made a pool to chosse the day and time of each training. We offer two session for each workshop in different timezones and record the training. The feedback was very good on the flexibility aspect but many champions request to know in advance when the session will happen.\n\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Workshop Session\nThere is a check list of task to fo for each training session.\n\nOne day before the training session:\n\n\nUse the template to create the collaborative note taking document. Remember to check with champions if the tool is accessible for them.\nSend and email and post a message on the Slack channel with a reminder of the training. Include the link to the zoom meeting and the session material.\n\n\nBefore the start of the training session:\n\n\nOne hour before the training session send and email and post a message on the Slack channel tagging to the channel with a reminder of the training. Include the link to the zoom meeting and the session material.\nStart the meeting 15 minutes early.\nWhen the instructor join, give co-host permission. Check audio, video and screen sharing. Check access to the document and link to the materials.\n\n\nDuring the training session:\n\n\nRemove the waiting room and allow all participants to join.\nWelcome the attendees and mention we will record the session. Start the recording. All the material is only shared with the cohort.\nMention the CoC, share the collaborative note taking doc, introduce the instructor and pass the lead of the session to them.\nShare on the chat the links to the collaborative note taking document.\nManage the breakout rooms.\nShare the anonymous feedback survey (last 5 minutes) for people to fill before they leave.\n\n\nAfter the training\n\n\nCheck the feedback survey and decide what can be improve for the next session.\nWhen the video recording is ready, create the folder for the session in the google drive for the cohort and upload all the necessary files. Edit the video if necessary, and summary the content with timestamp.\nThen send the email and post the message in Slack sharing the following materials:\n\n\nSlides.\nVideo.\nVideo summary with timestamp (this is generated with Zoom tools).\n\nAutomatic Subtitles.\nChat.\nTranscript.\nShared notes.\nLink to Feedback Survey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nVideo summary with timestamp, automatic subtitles, transcript and chat are tools to increase the accesibility of the material.\nThe summary with timestamos was also a request from champions of the first cohort to check the material without the need to watch all the video.\n\n\n\n5.4.2.1 Invitation mail template\n\n“Dear Champions and Mentors.
