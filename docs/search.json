    "section": "2.1 Program background and rationale",
    "text": "2.1 Program background and rationale\nIn 2022, rOpenSci was awarded $400K in funding as part of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) Open Science program’s education and capacity building strategy. The funding supports a new champions program to enable more members of historically excluded groups to participate in, benefit from, and become leaders in the R, research software engineering, and open source and open science communities.\nDevelopers in the R and open source communities are overwhelmingly white, male, from a handful of countries, able, and primarily English-speaking. The rOpenSci Champions Program is for people from historically and systematically excluded groups who are interested in contributing to rOpenSci and the broader open-source and open-science communities.\nThe 12-month-long program includes cohort-based training, project development support, and personal mentorship. Each cohort has ten champions and ten mentors. Champions participate in the following activities:\n\nTraining: this is the first stage. Champions will learn about open-source scientific software development good practices, R package development, code peer-open-review, contribute to open-source software initiatives and communities, and organize outreach activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOne of the goals of this program was to ensure that all participants gained new skills and understanding. We wanted to support Champions and Mentors, as well as those who applied to the program but were not selected. Therefore, we ensured that all groups had access to different training opportunities.\n\n\n\nIndividual Project development: Champions must develop the project they propose in their application. They have three options: develop a new R package or become part of the software peer review process as an author or as a reviewer.\nOutreach activity: the third stage involves an outreach activity for their home institution or local community. Examples of activities are: writing a blog post, teaching a workshop, talking at an event or organizing a meetup.\nMentoring and cohort: During each stage of the program, there is 1:1 mentoring and quarterly cohort meetings.\nStipend: we also pay a stipend to champions for participating. This has been important for champions to be able to dedicate time to the activity.\n\n\n\nChampions Program elements",

    "text": "2.2 Program goals\nThe rOpenSci Champions Program aims to support R developers from around the world who identify as members of a group that is systematically excluded from the open software community. Participants will:\n\nGain the skills to develop their own R package or gain confidence in submitting an R package for peer review or become a reviewer.\nLearn how to lead a workshop or other event about package development or software peer review - or another rOpenSci activity - in their local community or host institution.\nConnect with a supportive network of peers and mentors within the R ecosystem.\nProvide feedback to help rOpenSci to continue to host relevant, welcoming activities for R developers.\nGain transferable skills and experiences that are sought after for careers in open-source software.\n\nSuccess will look like:\n\nOver 80% of selected champions complete training and cohort meetings\nMentors and mentees build rapport during the program and a strong working relationship. This looks like:\n\nSchedule and attend regular check-ins\nTimely feedback on projects\n\nOver 80% of selected champions will either:\n\nBuild a new package\nComplete the peer review process as an author\nComplete the peer review process as a reviewer\n\nAll selected champions will conduct at least one outreach and/or recruitment activity to promote participation in peer review and contribution to rOpenSci open source software, infrastructure, and documentation. Examples include:\n\nGiving a presentation about rOpenSci at their home institution\nWriting a blog post\nOrganizing a peer groups in their communities\n\nAll champions and mentors will gather and share feedback on where rOpenSci’s current programming might be improved to meet the needs of all who wish to participate. Feedback may be shared in the following ways:\n\nVia email to the rOpenSci community manager\nVerbally, during training\nVia questionnaires / surveys",

This agreement helps to set and clarify expectation for the program.\n\nrOpenSci Champions Program - Champions Pledge 2024\nAttendance\nYou’re expected to attend each of the different meetings and activities for the champions program. You are also expected to attend all the meetings you will agree with your mentor.\nThe rOpenSci Champions Program is a peer-based mentoring program, meaning a significant part of your experience will take place with your cohort. Your attendance at the kickoff, training, and cohort meetings is crucial to your group’s mutual success.\nWe will ask you to let us know beforehand If you’re unable to attend an activity. It is important to organize it and find a way for you to complete the activities. We want you to succeed in the program, so we will contact you If you miss four or more meetings or you are not engaged with the program to discuss your participation. We want to ensure you and your group have an impactful and worthwhile experience.\nParticipation\nWe want you and your peers to grow enormously, and your engagement is key to that. Make intentional time to read the resources, provide feedback, and, when asked, complete the activities ahead of your meetings to get the most out of the training and other activities.\nThe Slack channels with other champions and mentors and the Slack workspace with the general rOpenSci community are vital spaces for communication and engagement.\nWe will ask you for anonymous feedback on the program activities. This feedback will inform our decision on the program improvement.\nSound good?\nPlease sign below (by checking the box and sending the form) to indicate that you have read this agreement, consent to us collecting these data, and that you understand and agree to the terms described in this agreement.\n\n\n\n4.3.2.3 Kick-off meeting and initial mentor/mentee introductions\nThe community manager hosts a kick-off meeting to introduce the champions to each other, provide an overview of the program, review the tentative training schedule and expectations for the program.\nThe community manager also shares information about tool and infrastructure that will be used to communicate and collaborate during the program, such as Slack, Google Drive, template docs, and shared calendar.\nKick-off meeting materials:\n\nSlides Champion Program KickOff 2022-2023\nTemplate Shared Notes - KickOff 2022-2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor accessibility reason google docs are not always the best option to share notes.

All information is available with open license and up to date on the Champions Program web site and this playbook.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Champion and mentor 1-on-1 meetings\nMentors are positioned to help champions progress their projects, answer questions, and provide motivation and support. One way for the pair to keep up to date with each other is by monthly 1-on-1 meetings, of which they are expected to have around 10 and can have more. The meetings should be about 30 minutes, but can be shorter or longer depending on both people’s needs and availability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe program expectation is that mentors will contact their mentee and organize the firts meeting.\nOne of the topic to discuss during that meeting is how they will work together during the program.\n\n\nMentor and champion pairs are expected to decide on meeting times and platforms with each other and are provided with a list of potential collaboration platforms including Zoom, Slack, WhatsApp, Google Docs, and When2Meet. They are also expected to read, implement, and abide by rOpenSci’s Code of Conduct in their meetings and interactions.\nAfter the mentor orientation, the mentors are given a template for their first meeting with their mentees and asked to set an agenda with goals, possible areas they can investigate, and expectations for each other. Mentors are expected to complete a form to confirm with the community manager that these monthly meetings are taking place.\nSubsequent meetings between the two will be structured as a check-in to ensure that the champion is keeping up with their goals and to answer any questions they may have. The meeting template document also provide agenda suggestion for these meetings. The final meeting will offer an opportunity for both to celebrate their accomplishments and offer feedback. More details about the meetings can be found in the Mentorship Meetings section of the Mentor Guidelines book.",

This series of 60 to 180-minute sessions will be supplemented by ongoing peer connection in a private Slack channel so that champions expand their own professional support networks while gaining new skills.\nAfter training, champions will organize peer groups in communities in which they are embedded. They will promote participation in peer review and contribution to rOpenSci open source software, infrastructure, and documentation and gather feedback on where rOpenSci’s current programming might be improved to meet the needs of all who wish to participate. The tenure and responsibilities of each cohort will have clear start and end dates and champions will receive an honorarium.",

    "text": "6.3 What to do when Champions are disengaged from the program\nIn the first year, the rOpenSci Community Manager noted that three of the ten champions were slightly off track from the goals of the program. One champion had a project idea that was out of scope, while two were not showing up to the training sessions and meetings.\nEach situation will be unique, and so it is important to consider the champion’s specific circumstances and tailor an intervention to the needs of the situation. However, some general guidelines can be helpful when champions are off track:\n\nHave one-on-one meetings with the champion and / or their mentor. Often, just talking through the problem can be enough to generate solutions.\nIntervene early and check-in often. Don’t let the problem get out of hand – at the first hints of an issue, reach out to the mentor or champion and make sure they are feeling supported.\nIf a champion can’t participate for whatever reason, offer the opportunity to another applicant.\n\nMake expectations for the program clear from the start in early communication, and disclose that lack of proper engagement may lead to removal from the champion program.\n\n\nIn the three specific situations listed above, speaking with the mentors and champions allowed the Community Manager to co-create solutions that fit everyone. The out of scope project will have a different status in the R ecosystem, but will still benefit from the rOpenSci review process and therefore be fast-tracked to publishing in a journal. Meanwhile, the disengagement was handled by changing training schedules to be more accommodating.",

Each one will focus on a project team, which will typically consist of a champion and mentor, and the content will include who they are (biographical information) and what the project is about.\nThe champions and mentors have already filled out an airtable form with headshots and other biographical information that will be useful in these blog posts.

It is important to organize training sessions accommodating these time zones, and to take into account that the United States and the UK have Daylight Savings time in March and November which disrupt typical time differences.\nAn important solution is to ask for the applicant’s time zone in the application form for the champion program to ensure that all those accepted will have some working-hour overlap in which they are able to meet.\nA helpful resource for planning across time zones is this Time Zone Converter – Time Difference Calculator which allows you to compare times in several time zones at once and determine whether it is during waking hours or not.",

    "text": "5.4 Training Session Organization\n\n5.4.1 Schedule\nChampions share their availability in a pool and the Community Manager select with the instructor availability the best day of the week and time during the day for maximizing attendance.\nHalf of the weekly session are schedule and the invitation are sent with a detail of the topic of each workshop with the material we will use in advance. When half of the session were completed the time of the session changes to accommodate better those champions that can’t attend the first option synchronously.\nThis configuration is a good mix between flexibility in the timing of training and knowing the schedule in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor the first cohort we made a pool to chosse the day and time of each training. We offer two session for each workshop in different timezones and record the training. The feedback was very good on the flexibility aspect but many champions request to know in advance when the session will happen.\n\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Workshop Session\nThere is a check list of task to fo for each training session.\n\nOne day before the training session:\n\n\nUse the template to create the collaborative note taking document. Remember to check with champions if the tool is accessible for them.\nSend and email and post a message on the Slack channel with a reminder of the training. Include the link to the zoom meeting and the session material.\n\n\nBefore the start of the training session:\n\n\nOne hour before the training session send and email and post a message on the Slack channel tagging to the channel with a reminder of the training. Include the link to the zoom meeting and the session material.\nStart the meeting 15 minutes early.\nWhen the instructor join, give co-host permission. Check audio, video and screen sharing. Check access to the document and link to the materials.\n\n\nDuring the training session:\n\n\nRemove the waiting room and allow all participants to join.\nWelcome the attendees and mention we will record the session. Start the recording. All the material is only shared with the cohort.\nMention the CoC, share the collaborative note taking doc, introduce the instructor and pass the lead of the session to them.\nShare on the chat the links to the collaborative note taking document.\nManage the breakout rooms.\nShare the anonymous feedback survey (last 5 minutes) for people to fill before they leave.\n\n\nAfter the training\n\n\nCheck the feedback survey and decide what can be improve for the next session.\nWhen the video recording is ready, create the folder for the session in the google drive for the cohort and upload all the necessary files. Edit the video if necessary, and summary the content with timestamp.\nThen send the email and post the message in Slack sharing the following materials:\n\n\nSlides.\nVideo.\nVideo summary with timestamp (this is generated with Zoom tools).\n\nAutomatic Subtitles.\nChat.\nTranscript.\nShared notes.\nLink to Feedback Survey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nVideo summary with timestamp, automatic subtitles, transcript and chat are tools to increase the accesibility of the material.\nThe summary with timestamos was also a request from champions of the first cohort to check the material without the need to watch all the video.\n\n\n\n5.4.2.1 Invitation mail template\n\n“Dear Champions and Mentors. This is the invitation to our next training session on [topic]\n[Name of the instructor] will be our speaker. [Name of the instructor] is [short bio].\nThis training is open to all. It is especially important for champions who are going to send a package for review or are going to become a reviewer. It is optional for mentors.”",

    "section": "6.2 Internal communication",
    "text": "6.2 Internal communication\nCommunication with champions and mentors takes place in the following spaces:\n\nSlack (more detail in ?sec-infrastructure).\nEmail.\nChampions Program meetings (training sessions, cohort meetings, etc.)\n\nThe Program Manager share important information using always two channels: Slack and emails. Most of the time is the same message for both media.\n\n6.2.1 What to do when Champions are disengaged from the program\nIn the first year, the rOpenSci Community Manager noted that three of the ten champions were slightly off track from the goals of the program. One champion had a project idea that was out of scope, while two were not showing up to the training sessions and meetings.\nEach situation will be unique, and so it is important to consider the champion’s specific circumstances and tailor an intervention to the needs of the situation. However, some general guidelines can be helpful when champions are off track:\n\nHave one-on-one meetings with the champion and / or their mentor. Often, just talking through the problem can be enough to generate solutions.\nIntervene early and check-in often. Don’t let the problem get out of hand – at the first hints of an issue, reach out to the mentor or champion and make sure they are feeling supported.\nIf a champion can’t participate for whatever reason, offer the opportunity to another applicant.\n\nMake expectations for the program clear from the start in early communication, and disclose that lack of proper engagement may lead to removal from the champion program.\n\n\nIn the three specific situations listed above, speaking with the mentors and champions allowed the Community Manager to co-create solutions that fit everyone. The out of scope project will have a different status in the R ecosystem, but will still benefit from the rOpenSci review process and therefore be fast-tracked to publishing in a journal. Meanwhile, the disengagement was handled by changing training schedules to be more accommodating.\n\n\n6.2.2 Time Zone Concerns\nGiven the explicit goal of including a diverse range of people in the champion program, the issue of time zones has emerged – champions have nine hour time differences. It is important to organize training sessions accommodating these time zones, and to take into account that the United States and the UK have Daylight Savings time in March and November which disrupt typical time differences.\nAn important solution is to ask for the applicant’s time zone in the application form for the champion program to ensure that all those accepted will have some working-hour overlap in which they are able to meet.\nA helpful resource for planning across time zones is this Time Zone Converter – Time Difference Calculator which allows you to compare times in several time zones at once and determine whether it is during waking hours or not.\n\n\n6.2.3 Coffee Chats\nThe Community Manager should set up coffee chats for the champions. This is a great way to give them permission to reach out to one another outside of facilitated chats, and allows them to connect outside of official meeting times. It will add to the sense of camaraderie and community if they have personal connections to one another; champions have already noted and interest in engaging with each other outside of training sessions.\n\n\n6.2.4 Offices hours and co-working session",

    "text": "6.1 External communication\nThere will be a series of blog posts introducing participants, thanking mentors and trainers, discussing the champion program, and documenting what has been learned so far. Blog post would be shared on other media and can be complement with other kinds of communication artifacts.\nThe blog posts will be a way of codifying everything the champions are learning, and shows them how far they’ve come. It also offers visibility for all involved in the program, including mentors, champions, and trainers, as well as being useful content to share with funders.\nBlog posts are also a nice way to thank and acknowledge the contributions of all the folks involved in the champion program.\nThe external communication use the following media:\n\nChampions Web Page.\nrOpenSci Blog Post and Newsletter.\nrOpenSci Social Media.\nrOpenSci Community Calls and Co-working sessions.\nEvents with other communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDuring the two years pilot of the program the social media landscape changed substantially due to the change of ownership of X (former Twitter), which implied a change in the way the program was communicated externally.\n\n\nAs the ?sec-comm-plan-recruitment details the communication plan for the Recruiting champions and mentors phase and how we use the differents media, in the following sessions we describe the communication plan and tools for the rest of the phase of the Champions Program.\n\n6.1.1 Selection and onboarding\n\nThe first step is to inform the results of the call, e.g. the number of applications received, the type of project and from where are the applicants.\n\nFor example, this blog post for the first cohort rOpenSci Champions Program Kick off (also in Spanish) presents general stats for the applications and introduce the selected participants. Also share information about the kick-off meetings and training activities.\nThis Mastodon post is about the second cohort:\n\n\nAll blog post are shared on the monthly newsletter and in some Slack related with the program.\n\nThe second step is to update the Champions Program webpage:\nCreate an author profile for each Champions and Mentor selected: this will allow Champions and Mentors to be author on different type of contributions to rOpenSci.\nList them on the Champions Program’s web page: this means upload their profile picture and add their affiliation and path for communication.\nRemove from the main page all of the information about the open call.\nAdd the information about the program’s timeline on the main webpage.\nThe third step is draft the blog post introducing champions and mentors to the community. We tried two ideas to communicate about the selected champions and mentors.\n\n\n6.1.1.1 Blog post series on champions and mentors\nFor the first cohort we write a series of ten blog posts, two each week. Each one will focus on a project team, which will typically consist of a champion and mentor, and the content will include who they are (biographical information) and what the project is about.\nThe Champions and Mentors have already filled out an AirTable form with headshots and other biographical information that will be useful in these blog posts. The Community Manager will create the skeleton with the info she already has, and the champions / mentors can edit it.\nThis are the published blog post in the series:\n\nrOpenSci Champions Program Teams: Meet Ghozayel Elotteebi and Zebulun Arendsee\nrOpenSci Champions Program Teams: Meet Alican Cagri Gokcek and Elio Campitelli\nrOpenSci Champions Program Teams: Meet Cheryl Isabella Lim and Mauro Lepore\nrOpenSci Champions Program Teams: Meet César and Marc\nrOpenSci Champions Program Teams: Meet Victor Ordu and Laura DeCicco\nrOpenSci Champions Program Teams: Meet Haydee Svab and Beatriz Milz\nrOpenSci Champions Program Teams: Meet Carolina Pradier and Athanasia Monika Mowinckel\nrOpenSci Champions Program Teams: Meet Bilikisu Wunmi Olatunji and Christina Maimone\nrOpenSci Champions Program Teams: Meet Marcos Prunello and Lukas Wallrich\nrOpenSci Champions Program Teams: Meet Pao Corrales and Adam Sparks\n\nFor the second cohort, we selected Mentors first because they helped with the review and final selection of champions. We decide to do two blog post, the first one introducing mentors and after the Champions selection was finished one blog post introducing champions.\nThe process was the same we use for the first cohort strategy regarding using the AirTable picture and information. We provide better instruction on how to write the text, for example, write your bibliography in the first person. The result was less time to edit the text for the blog post and less time to review the text by mentors and champions before post them.\nThese are the two second cohort’s introduction blog post:\n\nIntroducing rOpenSci Champions - Cohort 2023-2024\nIntroducing rOpenSci Mentors - Cohort 2023-2024\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Training\nDuring champion and mentor training we report at three points:\n\nEach meeting is mentioned on social networks, the topic, who the instructors are and the materials are shared. You can also accompany the social media post with a screenshot of the workshop attendees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the workshops we identify topics and advice that result in blog posts published on our website, or on the instructors’ websites. They are shared in the newsletter and on social media.\n\n\nAn Example of the DRY/DAMP Principles for Package Tests\nBeautiful Code, Because We’re Worth It!\nMarketing Ideas For Your Package\n\n\nAt the end of the training phase, a blog post is made closing this stage where we share how the training was structured, what topics were taught and the feedback from the attendees.\n\n\nBlog post for the first cohort: rOpenSci Champions Pilot Year: Training Wrap-Up\n\n\n\nThis helps to share with the community what is happening in real time, what was learned during the whole process and makes the materials available for the community to benefit from.\nFinally, the training details are include in the final report for our funders.\n\n\n6.1.3 Champions Project and Outreach\nThere are two goals in the communication about Champions’ projects and outreach activity:\n\nShare details about the projects with the community.\nSupport champions outreach activity spreading the word and sharing results.\n\nFor example, this is a series of post on social media about each Champion project:\n\nPackage eph: https://hachyderm.io/@rOpenSci/110967418654944210\nPackage naijR: https://hachyderm.io/@rOpenSci/110972893704549099\nPackage Agroclimatico: https://hachyderm.io/@rOpenSci/111030133176328601\nCagri’s project: https://hachyderm.io/@rOpenSci/111063737136002081\nPackage Lextale: https://hachyderm.io/@rOpenSci/111057655654084693\nPackage chartkickR: https://hachyderm.io/@rOpenSci/111052400785146165\nPackage karel: https://hachyderm.io/@rOpenSci/111046359173545680\nPackage rgeeextra: https://hachyderm.io/@rOpenSci/110985914847076073\nPackage odbr: https://hachyderm.io/@rOpenSci/110978882839376351\n\nThese are two blog post, the first one is a Champions’ blog post and the second one a summary of all Champions’ activities:\n\nrOpensci Champions Program: My Experience by Bilikisu Wunmi Olatunji.\nParticipación Latinoamérica en el Programa de Campeonas y Campeones de rOpenSci\nSocial media post about the Latin American projects blog post\n\n\n\nTo support the outreach activities we publish the event in rOpenSci Events Calendar, announce it on social media and different Slack before the event. After the event we publish the material on rOpenSci website, vimeo and Slack. We shared these material on social media.\nFor example for the package eph organize a Community Call in Spanish. These are the communication pieces, also in Spanish:\n\nEvent post on the rOpenSci Website: before the event is listed on the webpage with information about what, when, where and how to join. After the same web page list all the materials like slides and video.\nMastodon post inviting people to the event\nMastodon thread explaining the improvments on the eph package and inviting to the event\nMastodon post after published all the materials of the eph event\n\n\n\n6.1.4 Offboarding and evaluation\nThe external communication contemplates to write funder reports and summarizing activities and results for the wider community.\n\nrOpenSci Champions Pilot Year: Projects Wrap-Up\n\n\n\n6.1.5 Blog post series on documenting the program\nDuring all the pilot of the Champions Program, we discuss and documents our processes. We also change those base on our participant and community feedback. We write a series of blog post, organize events and delivered a series of talk to document and share what has been learned so far. Here are examples:\n\nBlog post: Fostering Equity and Leadership: the rOpenSci Champions Program Selection Process\nTalk: Fostering Diversity and Sustainability in the Open Source Scientific Software Community. The rOpenSci Champions Program\nEvent and blog post: How do you measure the impact of a champions program?\nTalk: A mentoring & training program for Scientific Open Source Champions",

    "title": "3  Recruitment and selection of champions and mentors",
    "section": "3.2 Applications",
    "text": "3.2 Applications\nThe application process for both champions and mentors is intentionally lightweight and consists of an airtable form and accompanying list of questions that applicants can review prior to submission.\nPotential champions program applicants are encouraged to attend an optional community call to learn more about the program and the application process. They may also attend an optional coworking session to work on their applications together, and/or book a brief 15-minute meeting with the community manager to get feedback on their applications.\n\n3.2.1 Champions application materials\n\nChampions Airtable application form. (The form is close if we don’t have an open call for applications)\nChampions application final questions. These are the questions in the application form. Available in English and Spanish.\nAfter the first year application, we create Frequently Asked Question (FAQs) for Champions. These FAQs improved response time to interested people’s queries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nApplication form template in google doc format for the 2022-23 application call. Preserved for archival reasons. Access only by the rOpenSci Champions Program Team. All information is available with open license and up to date on the Champions Program web site and this playbook.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Mentor application materials\n\nMentors Airtable application form. (The form is close if we don’t have an open call for applications)\nMentor application final list of questions. These are the question in the application form. Available in English and Spanish.\nAfter the first year we also create Frequently Asked Questions for Mentors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nApplication form template in google doc format for the 2022-23 application call. Preserved for archival reasons. Access only by the rOpenSci Champions Program Team. All information is available with open license and up to date on the Champions Program web site and this playbook.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Communications plan {?sec-comm-plan-recruitment}\nrOpenSci’s standard communication channels are used to spread the news about the champions program. There is a dedicated webpage, and blog post announcing the program and accompanying communications plan to promote the opportunity on social media and various listservs. In addition, the community manager hosts a community call about the program, and posts a recording on the rOpenSci website afterwards. The community manager may also speak at events and meetings hosted by other organizations to ensure the broadest possible reach.\nBefore beginning, decide which languages the recruitment materials will be translated into and identify translators if necessary. Remember to consider all the materials that will need to be translated (blog posts, video captions, social media posts (mastodon, linkedIn, slack), slides, and emails).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe materials outlined below are saved in this folder: 2. Communications plan.\nFor internal use by the rOpenSci Champions Program Team. Preserved for archival reasons. All information is available with open licence and up to date on the Champions Program web site and this playbook.\n\n\n\n3.2.3.1 Step 1: Update program web pages\nBefore beginning promotion, review the program webpage text and update as appropriate with new key dates and application materials.\nThe main Champions program webpage: present the information about:\n\nProgram general information like goals, format, and training.\nChampions and mentors information including eligibility criteria, benefits of taking part, expectations, timeline for the program, FAQs, and templates.\nApplication timeline template (example data for 2023-2024 call)\n2023-2024 Application timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nEvent\n\n\n\n\nJul 14\nCall for Champions and Mentor Applications opens 🎉\n\n\nJul 25\n[OPTIONAL] Community Call - Learn from other Mentors and Champions and get tips for submitting your application\n\n\nAug 17 & 23\n[OPTIONAL] Coworking Champions Application Clinics in different timezones (Aug 17 and Aug 23): receive help with your application to the Champions Program\n\n\nSep 4\nCall for applications closes\n\n\n\nTraining materials.\nEvents and blog post about the Champions Program.\nChampions and Mentors for each cohort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor the first cohort it is necessary to create the website from scratch and for that it is necessary to develop the program with objectives, measures of success, format, target audience, languages and write and build all the content.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3.2 Step 2: Draft blog and social media posts\nOnce the web pages have been updated, the community manager drafts blog posts to announce the opportunity. If possible, translate these posts into other languages. These blog posts may be linked to in additional outreach efforts such as social media posts and newsletters.\n\nBlog posts Announcing the rOpenSci Champions Program 2022-2023 (English and Spanish.\nBlog post Announcing the open call for Mentors 2022-2023: Become a Mentor for rOpenSci Champions!.\nBlog post announcing the open call for champions and mentors 2023-2024 (English and Spanish)\n\n\n\n3.2.3.3 Step 3: Create an outreach plan and draft related text and resources\nOnce the webpage and blog posts are ready, you are ready to begin promotion. The program should first be announced on the rOpenSci blog, newsletter, Slack, and social media sites.\n\nrOpenSci Newletter announcements examples: rOpenSci News Digest, September 2022, rOpenSci News Digest, October 2022, rOpenSci News Digest, July 2023, rOpenSci News Digest, August 2023.\nSocial media post examples:\n\n We also shared and boost former mentors and champions spreading the word about the call\n\n\n\nThen, promotion on other mailing lists and/or Slack workspaces can begin. To ensure a broad range of applicants, it may be helpful to give short presentations about the program at events or meetings hosted by other organisations or communities.\n\n\n\nPost with important dates and a community partner post sharing the second cohort call\n\n\nPost in portuguese, spanish and english sharing the open call for the second cohort:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe community manager may wish to conduct individual outreach to prospective mentors and champions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nEmail messages were the best media for individual outreach. In the message, it is important to include when and where the program manager knows the person and why they think they are a good fit for the Champions program.\nRemember to provide a way for individuals to be removed from future communications about the Champions program.\n\n\n\n3.2.3.3.1 3.1. Create a list of social media and email lists to post about the program.\nWe create a checklist with all the social media and mailing list we will share the open call of the Champions Program as an issue on GitHub (called task list). This issue helps to keep track of our dissemination task. We also note in what language is best to do the communication in each space to create the content.\nThis is an example of Slack work spaces were we share about the Champions Program 2022-2023 cohort:\n\nAsiaR\nCS&S\nCSCCE\nCSV Conf\nCZI\nFrench Speaking R Slack\nGitHub Partners\nLatinR (Spanish, Portuguese and English)\nLife Science Trainers\nMiR\nNotebooks Now!\nNumFOCUS\nOpen Science Community Saudi Arabia\nR User Groups Organizers\nR-Contributors\nR-Forwards\nR-Ladies Community (English, Spanish)\nR-Ladies Organizers (English, Spanish)\nR-Ladies Remote\nRConsortium\nReproHack\nrOpenSci\nRSE\nRStudio Certified Instructor\nThe Carpentries (English, Spanish)\nThe Turing Way\nuseR! 2021 Conf\nuseR! 2022 Conf\nWomen+ in Geospatial\n\n\n\n3.2.3.3.2 3.2. Draft the messages and schedulle for publication in each platform\nHere are examples of the message used to communicate about the program:\n\nSlack message:\n\n\nHi Community !! :wave: :mega: At rOpenSci we are thrilled to launch our Champions program!\nThe rOpenSci Champions Program is part of a series of activities and projects we are carrying out to ensure our research software serves everyone in our communities. That is why this program focuses on people who belong to groups that are historically and systematically excluded from the open software and research software communities and who are interested in contributing to rOpenSci and the broader open source and research software communities.\nIf you are selected as a Champion, over the course of a year you will develop a project, get training, and be mentored.

    "text": "3.3 Selection and matching process\nFor the first cohort the rOpenSci staff team was responsible for selecting both champions and mentors using screening rubrics.\nFor the second cohort the rOpenSci staff team was responsible for selecting mentors using screening rubric and then rOpenSci Champions Program Team and selected mentors review and select the final group of champions.\nBelow are details about each step of the selection and matching process, including suggested timelines.\n\n3.3.1 Step 1: Two rOpenSci Team members review application to confirm completion\nAfter the application deadline, the community manager with other team member review champions and mentors applicationsand set aside any candidates that don’t meet the basic criteria. Those application that are not complete or the project is not on the scope of the champions program are remove from the list.\n\n\n3.3.2 Step 2: Community manager assigns mentors applications to reviewers (1 week)\nThe community manager can evenly assign applications to each reviewer, taking into account any conflicts of interest. Each application has two reviews.\n\n\n3.3.3 Step 3: Selection team reviews their assigned mentors applicants (2 weeks)\nThe reviewers should consider all their assigned applications using the screening rubric and set aside any candidates that don’t meet the basic criteria.\nIn a slack private direct message group, the team discusses any doubts during the review. The doubts may be related to the rubric, to details in the application, etc\n\nrOpenSci Champions Mentors rubric template.\n\n\n\n3.3.4 Step 4: Meeting to discuss mentors applicants and final selection (1 week)\nThe selection committee should meet to discuss the top applicants. The goal of this meeting is to settle on a final list.\nBefore the meeting the community manager reviews all the applications with their scoring and prepares the final listfor mentors ordering the applications according to the score they obtained. The CM marks with different colors according to the scoring: definite yes, possible yes, or unsure.\nThe reviewers initially consider the definite and possible yeses which may be up to twice as many candidates who can be selected. Reviewers should take into account not only the ranking but also the country/region they come from, type of project they want to mentor, languages spoken, and gender.\n\n\n3.3.5 Step 5: Inform mentors applicants (2 weeks)\nOnce you have selected the top applicants, prepare individual messages to each person to inform them and request them to confirm their participation by a certain date. If for some reason a successful applicant can no longer participate, you can invite the next best applicant to take their place.\nAfter all selected mentors have confirmed their participation, prepare messages to inform applicants who were no selected.\n\n\n3.3.6 Step 6: Community manager assigns champions applications to reviewers (1 week)\nThe community manager can evenly assign applications to each reviewer, taking into account any conflicts of interest. Each application has two reviews.\nMentors for the current cohort are reviewers. Because of the high number of application we also invite mentor from previews cohort to review. We aim to assign between 10 to 20 applications to each reviewer.\n\n\n3.3.7 Step 7: Selection team reviews their assigned champions applicants (2 weeks)\nThe reviewers should consider all their assigned applications using the screening rubric.\nIn a slack private channel, the team discusses any doubts during the review. The doubts may be related to the rubric, to details in the application, etc\nThe team should take care to write substantive feedback as we attempt to provide each applicant with feedback that may be helpful to them in the future.\n\nrOpenSci Champions screening rubric template\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe full application is provide in the spreadsheet, but that format can be hard to read. We also provide a document in PDF format of each application when reviewers requested.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.8 Step 8: Consistency Analysis, and Diversity and Representation Review (1 week)\nA quantitative analysis is conducted to examine the consensus among reviewers. This step ensures that revisions are aligned, promoting fairness and minimizing bias in the selection process.\nWith a focus on diversity and representation, the list of candidates with higher scores is then carefully reviewed to ensure it reflects a broad spectrum of backgrounds and regions. This may involve adding promising candidates to the pool to achieve a truly representative group of potential champions. The program manager create a top candidate list that double the number of spots.\n\n\n3.3.9 Step 9: Final Selection by Mentors (1 week).\nThe culmination of the process consists of mentors reviewing the top candidates to select their mentees. Mentors tag every candidate with these options:\n\n3 projects with “I want to mentor this project.”\n7 projects “Should be part of the champions.”\n10 projects “No selected this time.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nInvolving mentors in the selection process significantly enhances the mentor-mentee relationship, as mentors’ insights into the selection process ensure a more effective and synergistic pairing. This involvement is crucial for identifying which projects resonate most with mentors, thereby facilitating a more informed and meaningful final match.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.10 Step 10: Final match mentor-mentee (1 week).\nThe program manager create the final match, taking into account the preference for the project, that the champions and mentors are in compatible time zones and speak a common language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nthe blog post Fostering Equity and Leadership: the rOpenSci Champions Program Selection Process explain the process in detail and shows the 2023-2024 cohort results.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.11 Step 11: Inform applicants (2 weeks)\nOnce you have selected the top applicants, prepare individual messages to each person to inform them and request them to confirm their participation by a certain date. If for some reason a successful applicant can no longer participate, you can invite the next best applicant to take their place (already matched in the previews step).\nAfter all selected champions have confirmed their participation, prepare messages to inform applicants who were no selected. Whenever possible, we try to include specific feedback to each applicant, so they can make improvements for next time. We also strive to direct them to other rOpenSci activities or opportunities that may be of interest to them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen the review takes longer than planned, we inform the applicants the status of the process by email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGoogle doc with templates for acceptance - rejection for champions and mentors.

    "text": "6.2 Selection and onboarding\n\nThe first step is to inform the results of the call, e.g. the number of applications received, the type of project and from where are the applicants.\n\nFor example, this blog post for the first cohort rOpenSci Champions Program Kick off (also in Spanish) presents general stats for the applications and introduce the selected participants. Also share information about the kick-off meetings and training activities.\nThis Mastodon post is about the second cohort:\n\n\nAll blog post are shared on the monthly newsletter and in some Slack related with the program.\n\nThe second step is to update the Champions Program webpage:\nCreate an author profile for each Champions and Mentor selected: this will allow Champions and Mentors to be author on different type of contributions to rOpenSci.\nList them on the Champions Program’s web page: this means upload their profile picture and add their affiliation and path for communication.\nRemove from the main page all of the information about the open call.\nAdd the information about the program’s timeline on the main webpage.\nThe third step is draft the blog post introducing champions and mentors to the community. We tried two ideas to communicate about the selected champions and mentors.\n\n\n6.2.0.1 Blog post series on champions and mentors\nFor the first cohort we write a series of ten blog posts, two each week. Each one will focus on a project team, which will typically consist of a champion and mentor, and the content will include who they are (biographical information) and what the project is about.\nThe Champions and Mentors have already filled out an AirTable form with headshots and other biographical information that will be useful in these blog posts. The Community Manager will create the skeleton with the info she already has, and the champions / mentors can edit it.\nThis are the published blog post in the series:\n\nrOpenSci Champions Program Teams: Meet Ghozayel Elotteebi and Zebulun Arendsee\nrOpenSci Champions Program Teams: Meet Alican Cagri Gokcek and Elio Campitelli\nrOpenSci Champions Program Teams: Meet Cheryl Isabella Lim and Mauro Lepore\nrOpenSci Champions Program Teams: Meet César and Marc\nrOpenSci Champions Program Teams: Meet Victor Ordu and Laura DeCicco\nrOpenSci Champions Program Teams: Meet Haydee Svab and Beatriz Milz\nrOpenSci Champions Program Teams: Meet Carolina Pradier and Athanasia Monika Mowinckel\nrOpenSci Champions Program Teams: Meet Bilikisu Wunmi Olatunji and Christina Maimone\nrOpenSci Champions Program Teams: Meet Marcos Prunello and Lukas Wallrich\nrOpenSci Champions Program Teams: Meet Pao Corrales and Adam Sparks\n\nFor the second cohort, we selected Mentors first because they helped with the review and final selection of champions. We decide to do two blog post, the first one introducing mentors and after the Champions selection was finished one blog post introducing champions.\nThe process was the same we use for the first cohort strategy regarding using the AirTable picture and information. We provide better instruction on how to write the text, for example, write your bibliography in the first person. The result was less time to edit the text for the blog post and less time to review the text by mentors and champions before post them.\nThese are the two second cohort’s introduction blog post:\n\nIntroducing rOpenSci Champions - Cohort 2023-2024\nIntroducing rOpenSci Mentors - Cohort 2023-2024",
