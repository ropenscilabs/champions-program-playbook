The funding supports a new champions program to enable more members of historically excluded groups to participate in, benefit from, and become leaders in the R, research software engineering, and open source and open science communities.\nDevelopers in the R and open source communities are overwhelmingly white, male, from a handful of countries, able, and primarily English-speaking. The rOpenSci Champions Program is for people from historically and systematically excluded groups who are interested in contributing to rOpenSci and the broader open source and open science communities.\nThe 12-month-long program includes cohort-based training, project development support, and personal mentorship. Champions participate in the following activities:",

    "text": "2.2 Program goals\nThe rOpenSci Champions Program aims to support R developers from around the world who identify as members of a group that is systematically excluded from the open software community. Participants will:\n\nGain the skills to develop their own R package or gain confidence in submitting an R package for peer review or become a reviewer.\nLearn how to lead a workshop or other event about package development or software peer review - or another rOpenSci activity - in their local community.\nConnect with a supportive network of peers and mentors within the R ecosystem.\nProvide feedback to help rOpenSci to continue to host relevant, welcoming activities for R developers.\nGain transferable skills and experiences that are sought after for careers in open source software.\n\nSuccess will look like:\n\nOver 80% of selected champions complete training and cohort meetings\nMentors and mentees build rapport during the program and a strong working relationship. This looks like:\n\nSchedule and attend regular check-ins\nTimely feedback on projects\n\nOver 80% of selected champions will either:\n\nBuild a new package\nComplete the peer review process as an author\nComplete the peer review process as a reviewer\n\nAll selected champions will conduct at least one outreach and/or recruitment activity to promote participation in peer review and contribution to rOpenSci open source software, infrastructure, and documentation. Examples include:\n\nGiving a presentation about rOpenSci at their home institution\nWriting a blog post\nOrganizing a peer groups in their communities\n\nAll champions and mentors will gather and share feedback on where rOpenSci’s current programming might be improved to meet the needs of all who wish to participate. Feedback may be shared in the following ways:\n\nVia email to the rOpenSci community manager\nVerbally, during training\nVia questionnaires / surveys",

    "title": "4  SECTION TWO: Recruitment and selection of champions and mentors",
    "section": "4.1 Overview",
    "text": "4.1 Overview\nThe recruitment process for champions and mentors should begin at least four months before the program start date to ensure there is adequate time to promote the opportunity, review applications, and communicate with successful and unsuccessful applicants. (During the pilot year, we received 74 champion applications and 28 mentor applications - so this process can take a significant amount of time!)\nTo ensure a broad range of applications from people across the world, we strive to offer information about the program in different languages. However, at this time, all applications must be written in English.\nBelow are details about the recruitment process for both champions and mentors including the applications, the communications plan and selection process.\n\n4.1.1 Applications\nThe application process for both champions and mentors is intentionally lightweight and consists of an airtable form and accompanying list of questions that applicants can review prior to submission.\nPotential champions program applicants are encouraged to attend an optional community call to learn more about the application process. They may also attend an optional coworking session to work on their applications together, and/or book a brief 15-minute meeting with the community manager to get feedback on their applications.\nChampions application materials\n\nChampions Airtable form: https://airtable.com/shrAsYlSXU0coJ5Ld\nChampions application final questions: https://ropensci.org/champions/files/champions_template/\nGoogle doc with draft text for the 2022-23 application: Application form template\n\n\n4.1.1.1 Mentor application materials\n\nAirtable form: https://airtable.com/shrlrLdQbb4wphosK\nList of questions (available in English and Spanish): https://ropensci.org/champions/files/mentors_champions_template/\nGoogle doc with draft text for the 2022-23 application: Mentors application form\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Communications plan\nrOpenSci’s standard communication channels are used to spread the news about the champions program, including a call for mentors. There is a dedicated webpage, and blog post announcing the program and accompanying communications plan to promote the opportunity on social media and various listservs. In addition, the community manager hosts a community call about the program, and posts a recording on the rOpenSci website afterwards. The community manager may also speak at events and meetings hosted by other organizations to ensure the broadest possible reach.\nBefore beginning, decide which languages the recruitment materials will be translated into and identify translators if necessary. Remember to consider all the materials that will need to be translated (blog posts, video captions, social media posts (twitter, mastodon, slack), slides, and emails).\nThe materials outlined below are saved in this folder: 2. Communications plan\n\n4.1.2.1 Step 1: Update program web pages\nBefore beginning promotion, review the program webpage text and update as appropriate with new key dates and application materials.\n\nMain Champions program webpage: https://ropensci.org/champions/\n\nGoogle doc with draft text: Champions Program Webpage\n\nMentor webpage: https://ropensci.org/champions/programdetailsmentors/\n\nGoogle doc with draft text:\n\nFAQs page:\n\nGoogle doc with Champions Program FAQs\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2.2 Step 2: Draft blog and social media posts\nOnce the web pages have been updated, the community manager drafts blog posts to announce the opportunity. If possible, translate these posts into other languages. These blog posts may be linked to in additional outreach efforts such as social media posts and newsletters.\n\nBlog posts announcing the 2022-23 champions program\n\nEnglish: https://ropensci.org/blog/2022/09/22/launch-champions-program/\nSpanish: ¡Anunciamos el programa de Campeones y Campeonas de rOpenSci!\n\nBlog post about mentors: https://ropensci.org/champions/programdetailsmentors/\n\n\n\n4.1.2.3 Step 3: Create an outreach plan and draft related text and resources\nOnce the webpage and blog posts are ready, you are ready to begin promotion. The program should first be announced on the rOpenSci blog, newsletter, Slack, and social media sites.\nThen, promotion on other mailing lists and/or Slack workspaces can begin. To ensure a broad range of applicants, it may be helpful to give short presentations about the program at events or meetings hosted by other organisations or communities.\nThe community manager may wish to conduct individual outreach to prospective mentors.\n\nCreate a list of social media and email lists to post about the program\n\nList and draft text for the 2022-23 program: Communications channels\n\nUpdate the rOpenSci outreach slide deck\n\nrOpenSci - Abuja RUG\n\nPost recordings on the rOpenSci event webpage: https://ropensci.org/events/abuja-2022/\n\nPresentation recording for the 2022-23 program: rOpenSci, a community for R developers and scientists, Yanina Bellini Saibene\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2.4 Step 4: Host application support activities\nThe community manager should plan two live sessions to support potential applicants: 1) a community call where applicants can ask specific questions about the application process and 2) a coworking session where applicants can work on the application together in real-time.\n\nApplication community call\nCo-working hours\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Selection and matching process\nThe rOpenSci team is responsible for selecting both champions and mentors using screening rubrics. Below are details about each step of the selection and matching process, including suggested timelines.\n\n4.1.3.1 Step 1: Community manager assigns applications to reviewers (1 week)\nAfter the application deadline, the community manager can evenly assign applications to each reviewer, taking into account any conflicts of interest.\n\n\n4.1.3.2 Step 2: Selection team reviews their assigned applicants (2 weeks)\nThe reviewers should consider all their assigned applications using the screening rubric and set aside any candidates that don’t meet the basic criteria. The team should take care to write substantive feedback as we attempt to provide each applicant with feedback that may be helpful to them in the future.\nIn a slack private direct message group, the team discusses any doubts during the review. The doubts may be related to the rubric, to details in the application, etc\n\nrOpenSci Champions screening rubric template\nrOpenSci Champions Mentors rubric template\n\n\n\n4.1.3.3 Step 3: Meeting to discuss applicants and potential mentor matches\nThe selection committee should meet to discuss the top applicants and consider potential mentor matches. The goal of this meeting is to settle on a final list.\nBefore the meeting the community manager reviews all the applications with their scoring and prepares the final list for champions and a final list for mentors ordering the applications according to the score they obtained. The CM marks with different colors according to the scoring: definite yes, possible yes, or unsure\nThe reviewers initially consider the definite and possible yeses which may be up to twice as many candidates who can be selected. Reviewers should take into account not only the ranking but also the country/region they come from, type of project proposed, languages spoken, and gender.\nWe also consider the champion’s proposed project alongside the mentor pool to ensure the type and topic is within the scope and that they can be well supported. We also take into account that the champions and mentors are in compatible time zones and speak a common language. Finally, the region and gender of the mentors are variables taken into account in the final selection.\nThe champion/mentor assignments are created by the CM with input from the team during the meeting, and then the team reviews that final mix. It is discussed asynchronously in the Slack group set up for the review.\n\n\n4.1.3.4 Step 4: Inform applicants (3 weeks)\nOnce you have selected the top applicants, prepare individual messages to each person to inform them and request them to confirm their participation by a certain date. If for some reason a successful applicant can no longer participate, you can invite the next best applicant to take their place.\nAfter all selected champions and mentors have confirmed their participation, prepare messages to inform applicants who were unsuccessful. Whenever possible, we try to include specific feedback to each applicant, so they can make improvements for next time. We also strive to direct them to other rOpenSci activities or opportunities that may be of interest to them.\n\nDraft text to applicants: Feedback for champions\n\n\n\n\n4.1.4 2022-23 Champions and Mentors\n\n\n\nChampion Name\nChampion Email\nProject type\nMentor Name\nMentor Email\n\n\n\n\nAlican Cagri Gokcek\nagokcek@unr.edu\n\nElio Campitelli\neliocampitelli@gmail.com\n\n\nBilikisu Wunmi Olatunji\nbilqiiswunmi@gmail.com\n\nChristina Maimone\nchristina.maimone@northwestern.edu\n\n\nCarolina Pradier\ncarolinapradier@gmail.com\n\nMo (Athanasia Mowinckel)\na.m.mowinckel@psykologi.uio.no\n\n\nCesar Luis Aybar Camacho\ncsaybar@gmail.com\n\nMarc Choisy\nmchoisy@oucru.org\n\n\nCheryl Isabella Lim\ncheryl.academic@gmail.com\n\nMauro Lepore\nmaurolepore@gmail.com\n\n\nGhozayel Elotteebi\ngzyl4work@gmail.com\n\nZebulun Arendsee\nzbwrnz@gmail.com\n\n\nHaydee Svab\nhsvab@hsvab.eng.br\n\nBeatriz Milz\nmilz.bea@gmail.com\n\n\nMarcos Miguel Prunello\nmarcosprunello@gmail.com\n\nLukas Walrick\nl.wallrich@bbk.ac.uk, lukas.wallrich@gmail.com\n\n\nPaola Belén Corrales\npaobcorrales@gmail.com\n\nAdam Sparks\nadamhsparks@icloud.com\n\n\nVictor Ordu\nvictorordu@outlook.com\n\nLaura DeCicco\nldecicco@usgs.gov\n\n\n\n\n4.1.4.1 2022-23 Mentors\nAdam Sparks\nBeatriz Milz\nChristina Maimone: christina.maimone@northwestern.edu, christina.maimone@northwestern.edu\nElio Campitelli\nLaura DeCicco: ldecicco@usgs.gov\nLukas Wallrich: l.wallrich@bbk.ac.uk, lukas.wallrich@gmail.com\nMarc Choisy:\nMauro Lepore: maurolepore@gmail.com\nMo (Athanasia):\nZebulun Arendsee: zbwrnz@gmail.com\n\n\n4.1.4.2 Champion Bios:\nAlican Cagri Gokcek. “My name is Alican Cagri Gokcek. I am originally from Turkey, and live in the United States right now. I am a visually impaired person since birth. I have a BA and MA in the department of Political Science and International Relations at Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey where I also spent three more years as a Ph.D. student before coming to the United States to start my new Ph.D. training from scratch in the department of Political Science at the University of Nevada, Reno in August 2022. My research interests are social movements and contentious politics with a specific focus on labor, international political economy with a special interest in capitalism’s crises and opportunities in the contemporary world, and computational social science with a specific focus on accessibility of statistics and statistical softwares in education. In the Champions Program, I aim at becoming a peer reviewer to contribute to the package evaluation processes from the point of view of the disabled. I believe that the Champions Program sends an invaluable message to the entire R community through its inclusiveness and respect for the people with underrepresented minorities.”\nBilikisu Wunmi Olatunji. “Bilikisu Wunmi Olatunji, MSc., University of Liverpool, UK. I’m a Data Scientist and RShiny Developer from Nigeria based in the country’s capital city, Abuja. I’m a certified RStudio Instructor for Tidyverse and R Shiny. I’m also. the founder and co-organizer of Abuja R Users Group and R-Ladies Abuja. My interest is in geospatial data science and I have been working on several related projects using R. As an independent consultant, I’m a certified Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Agile Coach. {PARAGRAPH} I’ll be working on a package to ease the use of geospatial data for Microplanning in public health. I’ll also be volunteering on other projects to strengthen the r open science community.”\nCarolina Pradier. “My name is Carolina Pradier, I am an economist and data scientist. I have a degree in Economics, and I am currently finishing my Master’s degree in Labour Studies, both at the University of Buenos Aires. I work as a research assistant at CEPED-UBA and I’m also an active member of Ecofeminita’s economics and data team (ecofemidata) and maintainer of the eph R package. Throughout the rOpenSci Champions Program I intend to enhance the eph R package (reorganizing the package, reducing its dependencies, improving the package’s functions’ processing speed, upgrading the user experience, etc.).\nI applied to the Program in order to improve my skills and bring new tools to the social scientists’ communities in which I am actively involved and thus strengthen our capacities to transform reality. Furthermore, I intend to bring researchers from my country closer to the R community and hope to meet new professionals I can collaborate with in the future. Needless to say, I am particularly excited about the prospect of participating in a program aimed at making the R community more inclusive.”\nCesar Luis Aybar Camacho. “My name is Cesar Luis Aybar Camacho. I am a Peruvian PhD student at the University of Valencia’s Image Processing Laboratory. I am also the main maintainer of the rgee package, which allows the integration of R and Google Earth Engine (GEE) in the same workflow. I am applying to the rOpenSci champion program because I want to contribute to developing a robust and diverse R community in LATAM. Besides, this is an excellent opportunity to gain insights from experts in the R community. As part of the program, I plan to create the rgeeExtra package, which will make GEE syntax more accessible to R users. Feel free to contact me after or during this program to assist or mentor your R package in Spanish or English. I will try my best.”\nCheryl Isabella Lim. “Hi! I’m Cheryl Isabella, an R enthusiast from Singapore. As the first female Asian POC to be inducted into this program, I’ll be trained as a Software Reviewer for ropensci’s peer review process. This means combining elements from academic peer review and production code review to apply Github features to packages from a range of broadly-defined categories. Through my role as an rOpenSci Champion, I expect to gain transferable skills and advocate for greater visibility of previously marginalised communities in STEM. Hopefully, this inaugural programme will be followed by collaborations and meaningful conversations between all individuals beyond their conventional camps.”\nGhozayel Elotteebi. “Hi, I’m Ghozayel Elotteebi, an [Open Science Community Saudi Arabia (OSCSA)] (https://osc-ksa.com/) member with an MA in applied linguistics. I’m based in the UK, completing my PhD at [the University of Nottingham] (https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/).\nI’ve developed a new package called [Lextale] (https://ghozayel.github.io/Lextale/). To my knowledge, this is the first R package in the field of linguistics developed in Saudi Arabia and would be the first local contribution to [rOpenSci] (https://ropensci.org/). I would love to create a community of contributors around the packages and promote advocacy for a culture of data sharing and reusable software, especially from MENA regions. Being part of [rOpenSci] (https://ropensci.org/) is an opportunity for networking with other champions/mentors from around the world, a potential to support the community, share experiences, and contribute to the existing body of reproducible science.”\nHaydee Svab. “I’m Haydee Svab, graduated in civil engineering, master of science - speciality transport and planning engineering. For the last few years I’ve been working as a researcher and consultant in my own company, ASK-AR. Our main projects deal with data analysis, smart cities, urban mobility and gender perspective. I was born and have always lived in Brazil, more specifically in São Paulo, where I founded the local RLadies chapter together with other amazing women. Despite loving and professionally working with the R language, I don’t know how to make packages - and I always wanted to make one, with data and models derived from my master’s dissertation. So, I saw in the Champion Program the opportunity to make that wish come true. Additionally, within the context of rOpenSci community, I recognize that the technical ability to create packages and its daily use can induce and facilitate the reuse and diffusion of codes from projects and initiatives that I am part of, be it R-Ladies or professional consultancy projects. Those will for sure benefit the R community, that will be able to leverage such packages.Finally, I am super excited for the learning period we will have and to get to know better and contribute to the rOpenSci community.”\nMarcos Prunello. “My name is Marcos Prunello and I’m from Argentina. I have a Bachelor of Science in Statistics from Universidad Nacional de Rosario (UNR) and an Academic Master of Science from Stanford University. I am currently working full time as a statistician and professor at UNR, where I have been teaching Statistics and Data Science for several years, training students in topics related to programming, exploratory data analysis, numerical methods and non-parametric statistics. I am also a co-founder of the R User Group in my city”“R in Rosario”” and I am frequently invited to different places to offer workshops on the use of R. As a work criterion, I have chosen to teach my classes and produce my study materials using R. In doing so I grew interested in being part of the community of developers that make data analysis tools available for everyone and developed some packages that are now in CRAN (“ggcleveland”, “geneticae”). However, I recently worked on a project that allowed me to combine my interest in teaching and software development: a bilingual package called karel that aims to teach general notions of programming in R in an interactive way for people without any kind of knowledge. Considering that education is a pillar for the construction of reproducible and open research, I applied to ROpenSci’s Champions Program to submit this package for discussion and review. I consider that this will be a good opportunity to get involved in a community of practice as a continuation of the path I am following and with the certainty that the experience acquired will have a positive impact in my work environment.”\nPao Corrales. “I’m a PhD student at the University of Buenos Aires. I study Atmospheric Sciences applying data assimilation techniques to improve short-term forecasts of severe events in Argentina. I love R and teaching science and programming using evidence-based practices centered on the students and their context. As a Champion, I would like to submit the {agroment} R package to the peer review process and gain more experience as a developer. I hope that this package, thoroughly documented in Spanish, for agrometeorological applications can be improved and used by many people. I’m also looking forward to sharing experiences between champions and learning from everyone during this process.”\nVictor Ordu. “Victor Ordu is a medical doctor with many years of experience in the Nigerian healthcare space. Having spent the first ten years of his career in clinical medicine he found a niche in health policy and environmental health regulation when he switched to the public health domain. Victor has worked in various capacities in both the public and private sectors including as a field consultant for the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in the WHO EMRO Region. Public health exposed him to the centrality of data management in determining health outcomes. The quest for the right tooling for the job began with EpiInfo and SPSS until he discovered R and instantly fell in love with the language. Since then he has not looked back. Now an independent consultant for the UN and international NGOs working in Nigeria, R has been the focus of much of his work. He also conducts R training programs for public and private organizations in Nigeria. Victor is an alumnus of the University of Nigeria and has also acquired certifications from the University of Heidelberg (Germany), the World Bank Institute, and Galilee Management Institute (Israel), to mention a few. He is an active member of the R community and has authored R packages that have found great use among R enthusiasts worldwide.”",

The community manager also shares information about tool and infrastructure that will be used to communicate and collaborate during the program, such as Slack, Google Drive, template docs, and shared calendar.\nKick-off meeting materials:\n\nrOpenSci - Champion Program - KickOff\nNotes - Kick-off Meeting Champions Program\n\n\n\n6.2.0.2 Step 2: Mentor training and orientation meeting\nAfter the initial kickoff, the mentors have a 75 minute meeting with the rOpenSci Community Manager with the purpose of giving them tools, skills, and guidance to provide good mentorship to the champions.\nThe overarching message of the meeting is that the role of a mentor is to advise and inspire. They can do this by recommending resources, offering feedback, and connecting their mentees to other people or programs.\nThe content of the first meeting can be broken down into a skills and tools section.\nThe skills are aimed at:\n\nActive listening\nEffective questioning\nGiving feedback\n\nTools include guidance on:\n\nSetting expectations for meetings\nThe GROW Model for exploring and reflecting\n\nGoal: Agree on a topic & objective or longer-term goals\nReality: self-assessment, specific examples\nOptions: suggestions offered & choices made\nWay forward: next steps\n\n\nDuring the meeting, mentors also have time to reflect on their own mentorship experiences (as a mentor or mentee), practice the GROW model, and consider their readiness for being a mentor.\n\n6.2.0.2.1 Mentor training and orientation materials\n\nrOpenSci Champions Program Mentor Guidelines v1.0\nSlide deck: rOpenSci - Champion Program - Mentorship Training and Orientation\nMentor materials and resources\nWeb page with instructors notes: https://ropensci-training.github.io/ropensci-mentors/\n\n\n\n\n6.2.0.3 Step 3: Champion and mentor 1-on-1 meetings\nMentors are positioned to help champions progress their projects, answer questions, and provide motivation and support. One way for the pair to keep up to date with each other is by monthly 1-on-1 meetings, of which they are expected to have around 11 and can have more. The meetings should be about 30 minutes, but can be shorter or longer depending on both people’s needs and availability.\nMentor and champion pairs are expected to decide on meeting times and platforms with each other and are provided with a list of potential collaboration platforms including Zoom, Slack, WhatsApp, Google Docs, and When2Meet. They are also expected to read, implement, and abide by rOpenSci’s Code of Conduct in their meetings and interactions.\nAfter the mentor orientation, the mentors are given a template for their first meeting with their mentees and asked to set an agenda with goals, possible areas they can investigate, and expectations for each other. Mentors are expected to complete a form to confirm with the community manager that these monthly meetings are taking place.\nSubsequent meetings between the two will be structured as a check-in to ensure that the champion is keeping up with their goals and to answer any questions they may have. The final meeting will offer an opportunity for both to celebrate their accomplishments and offer feedback. More details about the meetings can be found in the Mentorship Meetings section of the Mentor Guidebook.",

This series of 60 to 180-minute sessions will be supplemented by ongoing peer connection in a private Slack channel so that champions expand their own professional support networks while gaining new skills.\nAfter training, champions will organize peer groups in communities in which they are embedded. They will promote participation in peer review and contribution to rOpenSci open source software, infrastructure, and documentation and gather feedback on where rOpenSci’s current programming might be improved to meet the needs of all who wish to participate. The tenure and responsibilities of each cohort will have clear start and end dates and champions will receive an honorarium.\nWe will develop peer mentorship groups to support participants from historically excluded groups in their first technical contributions. Peer-mentorship groups will be facilitated by rOpenSci technical and community management staff, and also by community champions after Year One. Facilitators will provide training for technical activities (preparing a pull request, reviewing a package, preparing a package for submission or publication on rOpenSci infrastructure). Training will be followed by group “office hours”, 1-on-1 support, and closed group chats to support first-time participants in making their first open-source contributions through rOpenSci.",

    "text": "9.2 What to do when Champions are disengaged from the program\nIn the first year, the rOpenSci Community Manager noted that three of the ten champions were slightly off track from the goals of the program. One champion had a project idea that was out of scope, while two were not showing up to the training sessions and meetings.\nEach situation will be unique, and so it is important to consider the champion’s specific circumstances and tailor an intervention to the needs of the situation. However, some general guidelines can be helpful when champions are off track:\n\nHave one-on-one meetings with the champion and / or their mentor. Often, just talking through the problem can be enough to generate solutions.\nIntervene early and check-in often. Don’t let the problem get out of hand – at the first hints of an issue, reach out to the mentor or champion and make sure they are feeling supported.\nIf a champion can’t participate for whatever reason, offer the opportunity to another applicant.\n\nMake expectations for the program clear from the start in early communication, and disclose that lack of proper engagement may lead to removal from the champion program.\n\n\nIn the three specific situations listed above, speaking with the mentors and champions allowed the Community Manager to co-create solutions that fit everyone. The out of scope project will have a different status in the R ecosystem, but will still benefit from the rOpenSci review process and therefore be fast-tracked to publishing in a journal. Meanwhile, the disengagement was handled by changing training schedules to be more accommodating.",
