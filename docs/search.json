    "section": "2.1 Program background and rationale",
    "text": "2.1 Program background and rationale\nIn 2022, rOpenSci was awarded $400K in funding as part of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) Open Science program’s education and capacity building strategy. The funding supports a new champions program to enable more members of historically excluded groups to participate in, benefit from, and become leaders in the R, research software engineering, and open source and open science communities.\nDevelopers in the R and open source communities are overwhelmingly white, male, from a handful of countries, able, and primarily English-speaking. The rOpenSci Champions Program is for people from historically and systematically excluded groups who are interested in contributing to rOpenSci and the broader open-source and open-science communities.\nThe 12-month-long program includes cohort-based training, project development support, and personal mentorship. Each cohort has ten champions and ten mentors. Champions participate in the following activities:\n\nTraining: this is the first stage. Champions will learn about open-source scientific software development good practices, R package development, code peer-open-review, contribute to open-source software initiatives and communities, and organize outreach activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOne of the goals of this program was to ensure that all participants gained new skills and understanding. We wanted to support Champions and Mentors, as well as those who applied to the program but were not selected. Therefore, we ensured that all groups had access to different training opportunities.\n\n\n\nIndividual Project development: Champions must develop the project they propose in their application. They have three options: develop a new R package or become part of the software peer review process as an author or as a reviewer.\nOutreach activity: the third stage involves an outreach activity for their home institution or local community. Examples of activities are: writing a blog post, teaching a workshop, talking at an event or organizing a meetup.\nMentoring and cohort: During each stage of the program, there is 1:1 mentoring and quarterly cohort meetings.\nStipend: we also pay a stipend to champions for participating.  This has been important for champions to be able to dedicate time to the activity.",

    "text": "2.2 Program goals\nThe rOpenSci Champions Program aims to support R developers from around the world who identify as members of a group that is systematically excluded from the open software community. Participants will:\n\nGain the skills to develop their own R package or gain confidence in submitting an R package for peer review or become a reviewer.\nLearn how to lead a workshop or other event about package development or software peer review - or another rOpenSci activity - in their local community or host institution.\nConnect with a supportive network of peers and mentors within the R ecosystem.\nProvide feedback to help rOpenSci to continue to host relevant, welcoming activities for R developers.\nGain transferable skills and experiences that are sought after for careers in open-source software.\n\nSuccess will look like:\n\nOver 80% of selected champions complete training and cohort meetings\nMentors and mentees build rapport during the program and a strong working relationship. This looks like:\n\nSchedule and attend regular check-ins\nTimely feedback on projects\n\nOver 80% of selected champions will either:\n\nBuild a new package\nComplete the peer review process as an author\nComplete the peer review process as a reviewer\n\nAll selected champions will conduct at least one outreach and/or recruitment activity to promote participation in peer review and contribution to rOpenSci open source software, infrastructure, and documentation. Examples include:\n\nGiving a presentation about rOpenSci at their home institution\nWriting a blog post\nOrganizing a peer groups in their communities\n\nAll champions and mentors will gather and share feedback on where rOpenSci’s current programming might be improved to meet the needs of all who wish to participate. Feedback may be shared in the following ways:\n\nVia email to the rOpenSci community manager\nVerbally, during training\nVia questionnaires / surveys",

    "section": "3.1 Overview",
    "text": "3.1 Overview\nThe recruitment process for champions and mentors should begin at least four months before the program start date to ensure there is adequate time to promote the opportunity, review applications, and communicate with successful and unsuccessful applicants.\nDuring the first year, we received 74 champion applications and 28 mentor applications. In the second year we received 98 champions applications and 28 mentors applications - so this process can take a significant amount of time!\nTo ensure a broad range of applications from people across the world, we strive to offer information about the program in different languages. However, at this time, all applications must be written in English.\nBelow are details about the recruitment process for both champions and mentors including the applications, the communications plan and selection process.\n\n3.1.1 Applications\nThe application process for both champions and mentors is intentionally lightweight and consists of an airtable form and accompanying list of questions that applicants can review prior to submission.\nPotential champions program applicants are encouraged to attend an optional community call to learn more about the program and the application process. They may also attend an optional coworking session to work on their applications together, and/or book a brief 15-minute meeting with the community manager to get feedback on their applications.\n\n3.1.1.1 Champions application materials\n\nChampions Airtable application form. (The form is close if we don’t have an open call for applications)\nChampions application final questions (available in English. This are the questions in the application form.\nGoogle doc with draft text for the Champions 2022-23 application. This document is the application form template and it is accessible only to rOpenSci Champions Program Team.\nAfter the first year application we create Frequently Asked Question (FAQs) for Champions. This FAQs improved response time to interested people’s queries.\n\n\n\n3.1.1.2 Mentor application materials\n\nMentors Airtable application form. (The form is close if we don’t have an open call for applications)\nList of questions available in English and Spanish.\nGoogle doc with draft text for the 2022-23 Mentors application form.This document is the application form template and it is accessible only to rOpenSci Champions Program Team.\nAfter the first year we also create Frequently Asked Questions for Mentors\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Communications plan\nrOpenSci’s standard communication channels are used to spread the news about the champions program. There is a dedicated webpage, and blog post announcing the program and accompanying communications plan to promote the opportunity on social media and various listservs. In addition, the community manager hosts a community call about the program, and posts a recording on the rOpenSci website afterwards. The community manager may also speak at events and meetings hosted by other organizations to ensure the broadest possible reach.\nBefore beginning, decide which languages the recruitment materials will be translated into and identify translators if necessary. Remember to consider all the materials that will need to be translated (blog posts, video captions, social media posts (mastodon, linkedIn, slack), slides, and emails).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe materials outlined below are saved in this folder: 2. Communications plan.\nFor internal use by the rOpenSci Champions Program Team. Preserved for archival reasons. All information is available with open licence and up to date on the Champions Program web site and this playbook.\n\n\n\n3.1.2.1 Step 1: Update program web pages\nBefore beginning promotion, review the program webpage text and update as appropriate with new key dates and application materials.\nThe main Champions program webpage: present the information about:\n\nProgram general information like goals, format, and timeline.\nChampions and mentors information including eligibility criteria, benefits of taking part, expectations, timeline for the application and for the program, FAQs and templates.\nTraining materials.\nEvents and blog post about the Champions Program.\nChampions and Mentors for each cohort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor the first cohort it is necessary to create the website from scratch and for that it is necessary to develop the program with objectives, measures of success, format, target audience, languages and build all the content.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2.2 Step 2: Draft blog and social media posts\nOnce the web pages have been updated, the community manager drafts blog posts to announce the opportunity. If possible, translate these posts into other languages. These blog posts may be linked to in additional outreach efforts such as social media posts and newsletters.\n\nBlog posts Announcing the rOpenSci Champions Program 2022-2023 (English and Spanish.\nBlog post Announcing the open call for Mentors 2022-2023: Become a Mentor for rOpenSci Champions!.\nBlog post announcing the open call for champions and mentors 2023-2024 (English and Spanish)\n\n\n\n3.1.2.3 Step 3: Create an outreach plan and draft related text and resources\nOnce the webpage and blog posts are ready, you are ready to begin promotion. The program should first be announced on the rOpenSci blog, newsletter, Slack, and social media sites.\n\nrOpenSci Newletter announcements examples: rOpenSci News Digest, September 2022, rOpenSci News Digest, October 2022, rOpenSci News Digest, July 2023, rOpenSci News Digest, August 2023.\nSocial media post examples:\n\n \nThen, promotion on other mailing lists and/or Slack workspaces can begin. To ensure a broad range of applicants, it may be helpful to give short presentations about the program at events or meetings hosted by other organisations or communities.\nThe community manager may wish to conduct individual outreach to prospective mentors and champions.\n\n3.1.2.3.1 3.1. Create a list of social media and email lists to post about the program.\nWe create a checklist with all the social media and mailing list we will share the open call of the Champions Program as an issue on GitHub (called task list). This issue helps to keep track of our dissemination task. We also note in what language is best to do the communication in each space to create the content.\nThis is an example of Slack work spaces were we share about the Champions Program 2022-2023 cohort:\n\nAsiaR\nCS&S\nCSCCE\nCSV Conf\nCZI\nFrench Speaking R Slack\nGitHub Partners\nLatinR (Spanish, Portuguese and English)\nLife Science Trainers\nMiR\nNotebooks Now!\nNumFOCUS\nOpen Science Community Saudi Arabia\nR User Groups Organizers\nR-Contributors\nR-Forwards\nR-Ladies Community (English, Spanish)\nR-Ladies Organizers (English, Spanish)\nR-Ladies Remote\nRConsortium\nReproHack\nrOpenSci\nRSE\nRStudio Certified Instructor\nThe Carpentries (English, Spanish)\nThe Turing Way\nuseR! 2021 Conf\nuseR! 2022 Conf\nWomen+ in Geospatial\n\n\n\n3.1.2.3.2 3.2. Draft the messages and schedulle for publication in each platform\nHere are examples of the message used to communicate about the program:\n\nSlack message:\n\n\nHi Community !! :wave: :mega:At rOpenSci we are thrilled to launch our Champions program!\nThe rOpenSci Champions Program is part of a series of activities and projects we are carrying out to ensure our research software serves everyone in our communities. That is why this program focuses on people who belong to groups that are historically and systematically excluded from the open software and research software communities and who are interested in contributing to rOpenSci and the broader open source and research software communities.\nIf you are selected as a Champion, over the course of a year you will develop a project, get training, and be mentored. You will also receive a small stipend.\n:calendar: You can apply until November 7, 2022 using a form. You can read more details in this blog post.\nAnd, of course, you can contact me if you have any questions. :slightly_smiling_face:\nPlease share widely with people who may be interested. Thank you! :pray:\n\n\nList and draft text for the 2022-23 program for Communications channels. (For internal use by the rOpenSci Champions Program Team. Preserved for archival reasons. All information is available with open licence and up to date on the Champions Program web site and this playbook)\n\n\n\n3.1.2.3.3 3.2. Update the rOpenSci Champions Program outreach slide deck.\nThis are examples of promotional material for talks with local groups.\n\n*Champions Program Presentation at Abuja RUG - English\nPost recordings on the rOpenSci event webpage: https://ropensci.org/events/abuja-2022/\nPresentation recording for the 2022-23 program: rOpenSci, a community for R developers and scientists, Yanina Bellini Saibene\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2.4 Step 4: Host application support activities\nThe community manager should plan two live sessions to support potential applicants: 1) a community call where applicants can ask specific questions about the application process and 2) a coworking session where applicants can work on the application together in real-time.\n\nApplication community call\nCo-working hours\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Selection and matching process\nThe rOpenSci team is responsible for selecting both champions and mentors using screening rubrics. Below are details about each step of the selection and matching process, including suggested timelines.\n\n3.1.3.1 Step 1: Community manager assigns applications to reviewers (1 week)\nAfter the application deadline, the community manager can evenly assign applications to each reviewer, taking into account any conflicts of interest.\n\n\n3.1.3.2 Step 2: Selection team reviews their assigned applicants (2 weeks)\nThe reviewers should consider all their assigned applications using the screening rubric and set aside any candidates that don’t meet the basic criteria. The team should take care to write substantive feedback as we attempt to provide each applicant with feedback that may be helpful to them in the future.\nIn a slack private direct message group, the team discusses any doubts during the review. The doubts may be related to the rubric, to details in the application, etc\n\nrOpenSci Champions screening rubric template\nrOpenSci Champions Mentors rubric template\n\n\n\n3.1.3.3 Step 3: Meeting to discuss applicants and potential mentor matches\nThe selection committee should meet to discuss the top applicants and consider potential mentor matches. The goal of this meeting is to settle on a final list.\nBefore the meeting the community manager reviews all the applications with their scoring and prepares the final list for champions and a final list for mentors ordering the applications according to the score they obtained. The CM marks with different colors according to the scoring: definite yes, possible yes, or unsure\nThe reviewers initially consider the definite and possible yeses which may be up to twice as many candidates who can be selected. Reviewers should take into account not only the ranking but also the country/region they come from, type of project proposed, languages spoken, and gender.\nWe also consider the champion’s proposed project alongside the mentor pool to ensure the type and topic is within the scope and that they can be well supported. We also take into account that the champions and mentors are in compatible time zones and speak a common language. Finally, the region and gender of the mentors are variables taken into account in the final selection.\nThe champion/mentor assignments are created by the CM with input from the team during the meeting, and then the team reviews that final mix. It is discussed asynchronously in the Slack group set up for the review.\n\n\n3.1.3.4 Step 4: Inform applicants (3 weeks)\nOnce you have selected the top applicants, prepare individual messages to each person to inform them and request them to confirm their participation by a certain date. If for some reason a successful applicant can no longer participate, you can invite the next best applicant to take their place.\nAfter all selected champions and mentors have confirmed their participation, prepare messages to inform applicants who were unsuccessful. Whenever possible, we try to include specific feedback to each applicant, so they can make improvements for next time. We also strive to direct them to other rOpenSci activities or opportunities that may be of interest to them.\n\nDraft text to applicants: Feedback for champions\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 First Cohort 2022-2023.

The community manager also shares information about tool and infrastructure that will be used to communicate and collaborate during the program, such as Slack, Google Drive, template docs, and shared calendar.\nKick-off meeting materials:\n\nrOpenSci - Champion Program - KickOff\nNotes - Kick-off Meeting Champions Program\n\n\n\n4.2.0.2 Step 2: Mentor training and orientation meeting\nAfter the initial kickoff, the mentors have a 75 minute meeting with the rOpenSci Community Manager with the purpose of giving them tools, skills, and guidance to provide good mentorship to the champions.\nThe overarching message of the meeting is that the role of a mentor is to advise and inspire. They can do this by recommending resources, offering feedback, and connecting their mentees to other people or programs.\nThe content of the first meeting can be broken down into a skills and tools section.\nThe skills are aimed at:\n\nActive listening\nEffective questioning\nGiving feedback\n\nTools include guidance on:\n\nSetting expectations for meetings\nThe GROW Model for exploring and reflecting\n\nGoal: Agree on a topic & objective or longer-term goals\nReality: self-assessment, specific examples\nOptions: suggestions offered & choices made\nWay forward: next steps\n\n\nDuring the meeting, mentors also have time to reflect on their own mentorship experiences (as a mentor or mentee), practice the GROW model, and consider their readiness for being a mentor.\n\n4.2.0.2.1 Mentor training and orientation materials\n\nrOpenSci Champions Program Mentor Guidelines v1.0\nSlide deck: rOpenSci - Champion Program - Mentorship Training and Orientation\nMentor materials and resources\nWeb page with instructors notes: https://ropensci-training.github.io/ropensci-mentors/\n\n\n\n\n4.2.0.3 Step 3: Champion and mentor 1-on-1 meetings\nMentors are positioned to help champions progress their projects, answer questions, and provide motivation and support. One way for the pair to keep up to date with each other is by monthly 1-on-1 meetings, of which they are expected to have around 11 and can have more. The meetings should be about 30 minutes, but can be shorter or longer depending on both people’s needs and availability.\nMentor and champion pairs are expected to decide on meeting times and platforms with each other and are provided with a list of potential collaboration platforms including Zoom, Slack, WhatsApp, Google Docs, and When2Meet. They are also expected to read, implement, and abide by rOpenSci’s Code of Conduct in their meetings and interactions.\nAfter the mentor orientation, the mentors are given a template for their first meeting with their mentees and asked to set an agenda with goals, possible areas they can investigate, and expectations for each other. Mentors are expected to complete a form to confirm with the community manager that these monthly meetings are taking place.\nSubsequent meetings between the two will be structured as a check-in to ensure that the champion is keeping up with their goals and to answer any questions they may have. The final meeting will offer an opportunity for both to celebrate their accomplishments and offer feedback. More details about the meetings can be found in the Mentorship Meetings section of the Mentor Guidebook.",

    "text": "6.2 What to do when Champions are disengaged from the program\nIn the first year, the rOpenSci Community Manager noted that three of the ten champions were slightly off track from the goals of the program. One champion had a project idea that was out of scope, while two were not showing up to the training sessions and meetings.\nEach situation will be unique, and so it is important to consider the champion’s specific circumstances and tailor an intervention to the needs of the situation. However, some general guidelines can be helpful when champions are off track:\n\nHave one-on-one meetings with the champion and / or their mentor. Often, just talking through the problem can be enough to generate solutions.\nIntervene early and check-in often. Don’t let the problem get out of hand – at the first hints of an issue, reach out to the mentor or champion and make sure they are feeling supported.\nIf a champion can’t participate for whatever reason, offer the opportunity to another applicant.\n\nMake expectations for the program clear from the start in early communication, and disclose that lack of proper engagement may lead to removal from the champion program.\n\n\nIn the three specific situations listed above, speaking with the mentors and champions allowed the Community Manager to co-create solutions that fit everyone. The out of scope project will have a different status in the R ecosystem, but will still benefit from the rOpenSci review process and therefore be fast-tracked to publishing in a journal. Meanwhile, the disengagement was handled by changing training schedules to be more accommodating.",

It is important to organize training sessions accommodating these time zones, and to take into account that the United States and the UK have Daylight Savings time in March and November which disrupt typical time differences.\nAn important solution is to ask for the applicant’s time zone in the application form for the champion program to ensure that all those accepted will have some working-hour overlap in which they are able to meet.\nA helpful resource for planning across time zones is this Time Zone Converter – Time Difference Calculator which allows you to compare times in several time zones at once and determine whether it is during waking hours or not.",

When half of the session were completed the time of the session changes to accommodate better those champions that can’t attend the first option synchronously.\nThis configuration is a good mix between flexibility in the timing of training and knowing the schedule in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor the first cohort we made a pool to chosse the day and time of each training. We offer two session for each workshop in different timezones and record the training. The feedback was very good on the flexibility aspect but many champions request to know in advance when the session will happen.\n\n\n\n5.4.0.1 Invitation mail template\n“Dear Champions and Mentors.
