# Program overview

## Background and overview

In 2022, rOpenSci was awarded \$400K in funding as part of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) Open Science program’s education and capacity building strategy. The funding supported development of a new Champions Program to enable more members of historically excluded groups to participate in, benefit from, and become leaders in the R, research software engineering, and open source and open science communities.

Developers in the R and open source communities are overwhelmingly white, male, from a handful of countries, able, and primarily English-speaking. The rOpenSci Champions Program is for people from historically and systematically excluded groups who are interested in contributing to rOpenSci and the broader open-source and open-science communities.

The 12-month-long program includes cohort-based training, project development support, and personal mentorship. Each cohort has ten Champions and ten mentors. Champions participate in the following activities:

-   **Training:** Champions learn about open-source scientific software development good practices, R package development, open peer-review of code, contributing to open-source software initiatives and communities, and organizing outreach activities.

::: callout-note
One of the goals of this program was to ensure that all participants gained new skills and understanding. We wanted to support Champions and Mentors, as well as those who applied to the program but were not selected. Therefore, we included training opportunities open to both selected Champions as well as those who were un-selected.
:::

-   **Individual Project development:** Champions develop the project they proposed in their application. They have three options: develop a new R package, submit an R package for peer review, or become a peer reviewer of an R package.

-   **Outreach activity:** Champions develop and deliver an outreach activity for their home institution or local community. Examples of activities are: writing a blog post, teaching a workshop, talking at an event, and organizing a meetup.

-   **Relationships:** Throughout the program Champions develop relationships with their mentors through one-on-one meetings, and with the other Champions through quarterly cohort meetings.

-   **Stipend:** Champions receive a stipend for participating. This is important for reducing financial barriers, allowing Champions to be able to dedicate time to the activity.

Each one lists the activities for the three stages. Training: Dev. good practices, package development, code review, and contribution to OSS and outreach. Project: New package, Peer-review their package, Become a reviewer. Outreach: Write a blog post, Teach a workshop, Talk at an event, and Organize a meetup.

## Goals

The rOpenSci Champions Program aims to support R developers from around the world who identify as members of a group that is systematically excluded from the open software community. Participants will:

-   Gain the skills to develop their own R package or gain confidence in submitting an R package for peer review or become a reviewer.

-   Learn how to lead a workshop or similar event about package development or software peer review (or other rOpenSci activity) in their local community or host institution.

-   Connect with a supportive network of peers and mentors within the R ecosystem.

-   Provide feedback to help rOpenSci to continue to host relevant, welcoming activities for R developers.

-   Gain transferable skills and experiences that are valuable for careers in open-source software.

Success will look like:

-   Over 80% of Champions
    
    - Complete the trainings
    
    - Attend cohort meetings
    
    - Complete their project (build a new package; complete peer review as an author; or, complete peer review as a reviewer)

-   Mentors and mentees build rapport and strong working relationships.

    -   Both schedule and attend regular check-ins

    -   Mentors give timely feedback on projects


-   All selected Champions conduct at least one outreach and/or recruitment activity 
   to promote participation in peer review and contribution to rOpenSci open source software, 
   infrastructure, and documentation. Examples include:

    -   Give a presentation about rOpenSci at their home institution

    -   Write a blog post

    -   Organize a peer group in their communities

-   All Champions and mentors gather to share feedback on where rOpenSci’s current 
    programming might be improved to meet the needs of all who wish to participate. 
    Feedback may be shared in the following ways:

    -   Via email to the rOpenSci community manager

    -   Verbally, during training

    -   Via questionnaires / surveys
